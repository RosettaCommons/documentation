# Internal Documentation

[[_TOC_]]

##Introduction


This is the front page for the "internal" portion of the Rosetta documentation wiki.
It provides convenient access to documentation pages which are primarily intended for the RosettaCommons community, but can be publically released.
This is usually either things of primarily historical significance, developmental minutia, or in-work documentation which isn't ready for general consumption.

Documentation which is "internal-only" in nature should be placed on the internal password-protected RosettaCommons wiki (MediaWiki) instead.

See [[how to write documentation|how-to-write-documentation]] for more details.

## Core Class Modifications

If you change the API for a core class (particularly if you *remove*, *rename*, or *alter* an existing function), please make a note of it here to make it easy to communicate this to the development community and the PyRosetta community, and for future documentation in the release notes.  Note that this applies to any API change in core.5 or below (numeric, basic, _etc._).  Such changes should be avoided if possible, but if such a change is unavoidable, please do the following:

1.  E-mail the developer list.  Developers need to know, and a conversation needs to happen.  Do not proceed with the change without community approval.
2.  If the change is approved, make sure that the Gray lab knows.  The PyRosetta tutorials will need to change.
3.  If possible, maintain an old function with the old interface, with a tracer warning that this function will be deprecated and that the new function should be used instead.
4.  Document the change here, for future inclusion in the release notes:

| Date | Author | Description | Reason |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| 31 Aug 2016 | Andy Watkins | [Example]: core::pose::Pose::n_residue() was renamed to core::pose::Pose::size(). | An opportunity for maniacal laughter. |

## PyRosetta API changes
1. Since r59466 xyzMatrix now have .xy properties bound as 'data' instead of set/get functions. So if your code accessed this methods directly you will need to refactor it as m.xx( m.xy() ) --> m.xx = m.xy

### Design-specific scoring terms ###
- [[Repeat stretch energy (aa_repeat_energy)|Repeat-stretch-energy]] -- A scoring term that penalizes long stretches of repeating sequence (*e.g.* poly-Q sequences).
- [[Residue composition energy (aa_composition)|AACompositionEnergy]] -- A scoring term that penalizes deviation from a desired residue type composition (e.g. no more than 7% alanines; at least one aromatic; at least 40% hydrophobic).

### Cyclic Peptides / Geometrically-Constrained Polymers Project
- [[Peptide structure prediction with the simple_cycpep_predict app|internal_documentation/simple_cycpep_predict_app]]
- [[Workflow]]
- [[PeptideStubMover]]
- [[DeclareBond]]
- [[SetTorsion]] -- updated with new functionality; documentation needs to be written

### Stepwise Assembly and Monte Carlo Project
- [[General application documentation|stepwise]] is publicly viewable.
- [[Overview|stepwise-classes-overview]] of stepwise enumeration and monte carlo, both accessed through `stepwise` application
- [[Monte Carlo Moves|stepwise-classes-moves]] and the move schedule 
- [[SampleAndScreen|stepwise-sample-and-screen]] is a general class for enumerating or stochastically sampling residues (or rigid bodies) 
- [[Samplers|stepwise-samplers]] are concatenated together to define the sampling loop, and can go through millions of poses.
- [[Screeners|stepwise-screeners]] are filters with some specialized features to 'fast-forward' through the sampling loop and prevent memory effects in the pose. 
- [[FullModelInfo|stepwise-fullmodelinfo]] is an important book-keeping object held by the pose used throughout the stepwise code. 
- [[Score terms|stepwise-score]] calculate energies for a full model even if only subpieces are instantiated (other_pose, loop_close, free_side_chain).

### Fragment assembly of RNA (FARNA) renovation, unification with stepwise
- [[FARNA|farna-refactor]] is Rosetta's original RNA de novo modeling code (dating back to Rosetta++). It is undergoing some updates in 2015-2016.
