#Rosetta people
<!---BEGIN_INTERNAL-->
This page is the "Rosetta Glory", by analogy to the Rosetta [[Glossary]]: a list of important folks in the Rosetta community.  This page is intentionally kept clear of pictures and contact info for privacy reasons - you will be able to find these people on the rosetta-devel [[email list|https://wiki.rosettacommons.org/index.php/Mailing_Lists]] if necessary.

A comprehensive list of RosettaCommons PIs can be found [[here|http://www.rosettacommons.org/about]].
The PIs are not otherwise documented on this page. (If there's no more text on this page for you, that's because it is blanked for the public version.)

####Andrew Leaver-Fay
Andrew is the [[benevolent dictator|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life]] of the Rosetta codebase.
He is our most experienced computer scientist and software engineer, as well as having deep experience with almost all areas of Rosetta.
He is one of the few members of the community with the skills to optimize code.
He can answer almost any question, but as a consequence, is very busy.
Do feel free to ask for his help, but don't use him as your first resource.
You may see him as APL in in-code comments.

####Sergey Lyskov
Sergey maintains our [[testing server]] resources, as well as ROSIE, one of our major [[Rosetta servers]].
He is very responsive to requests for new features on either set of servers.
He is also a great person to talk to with questions about the testing architecture.

####Yi Liu, Eran Kuchuk, Yuval Sadan, Oriel Goldstein
These fine folks (in this chronological order) have served as **Rosetta Manager**, serving as content administrators for the website and handling code releases.
