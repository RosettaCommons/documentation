## PruneBuriedUnsats

Eliminate rotamers that contain a sidechain buried unsat and make no other sidechain h-bonds. Typically used with VBUNS (see [[buried unsat filter|scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/Filters/filter_pages/BuriedUnsatHbondsFilter]]) and the [[approximate_buried_unsat_penalty|rosetta_basics/scoring/ApproximateBuriedUnsatPenalty]].

     <PruneBuriedUnsats name="(&string)" allow_even_trades="(&bool, false)" atomic_depth_probe_radius="(&Real, 2.3)" atomic_depth_resolution="(&Real, 0.5)" atomic_depth_cutoff="(&Real, 4.5)" minimum_hbond_energy="(&Real, -0.2)" />

If using the approximate_buried_unsat_penalty, it would be wise to set this to the same parameters as that.

##Options

* allow_even_trades - Allow residues that satisfy an unsat and create a new unsatisfiable one.
* atomic_depth_probe_radius - Probe radius for atomic depth calculation to determine burial.
* atomic_depth_resolution - Voxel resolution with which to calculate atomic depth.
* atomic_depth_cutoff - Atomic depth at which atoms are considered buried.
* Minimum energy (out of the typical rosetta -2.0) for a hbond to be considered to satisfy a polar.

##Known limitations

This task operation does not currently support symmetric poses.
