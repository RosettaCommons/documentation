Many of the metric functions were first coded by Brian Weitzner (brian.weitzner@gmail.com) and Jeff Gray ([[http://graylab.jhu.edu]]) at JHU as part of RosettaAntibody 3.0. 

**Overview**

The Antibody Features Reporter is a subclass of the [[InterfaceFeatures |MultiBodyFeaturesReporters#InterfaceFeatures]] Reporter.  It outputs all tables as in the InterfaceFeatures for antibody-specific interfaces (combinations of L, H, and A where L is light, H is heavy, and A is antigen).  By default, it will analyze every antibody interface unless specified in the XML tag.  It will also add information on the antigen to the antibody tables. Use _skip_all_antigen_analysis_ to skip this reporting.  Works on camelid antibodies as well.

In order to use this Reporter, the antibody should be renumbered into a particular numbering scheme.  See [[General Antibody Tips | General-Antibody-Options-and-Tips]] for more information on how to renumber your antibody via different antibody servers.  If your antibody has come from RosettaAntibody 3.0, the antibody is already renumbered in the Chothia scheme, which is the default.  The numbering scheme can be specified through the command-line or via XML tag.

```xml
			<AntibodyFeatures scorefxn="(&string)" interface="(&string)" numbering_scheme="(&string, Chothia_Scheme)" cdr_definition="(&string, Aroop)" pack_separated="(&string, true)" pack_together="(&string, false)" />
```

**XML Options**

-   scorefxn (& scorefxn string): Specify a scorefunction to use
-   interface(s) (&string) (default=All present antibody interfaces):  Specify the interface as ChainsSide1_ChainsSide2 as in LH_A or a list of interfaces as LH_A,L_HA, etc.  Accepted Interface Strings: L_H, L_A, H_A, and LH_A
-   numbering_scheme (&string):  Set the antibody numbering scheme.  Must also set the cdr_definition XML option. Both options can also be set through the command line (recommended).  See [[General Antibody Tips | General-Antibody-Options-and-Tips]] for more info.
-   cdr_definition (&string): Set the cdr definition you want to use.  Must also set the numbering_scheme XML option.  See [[General Antibody Tips | General-Antibody-Options-and-Tips]]


**More XML Options**
-   pack_separated (&bool) (default=false): Repack the detected interface residues during separation.
-   pack_together (&bool) (default=true): Repack the detected interface residues when they are together.
-   dSASA_cutoff (&real) (default=100): Buried Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) cutoff to ignore reporting most values.
-   compute_packstat (&bool) (default=true): Compute the PackStat (RosettaHoles 1.0) value of the interface?  Typically it takes a tiny bit more time.  Sometimes packstat is buggy.  If you are having errors in packstat, try switching this off.  
-   skip_all_antigen_analysis (&bool) (default=false): By default if antigen is present, we will report some data on it.  Pass this option to true to skip antigen reporting.

##Beta-Sandwiches

###SandwichFeatures

**Overview**

Function summary: Extract and analyze beta-sandwiches

Extraction: Extract beta-sandwiches conservatively so that it correctly excludes alpha-helix that is identified as beta-sandwich by SCOP and excludes beta-barrel that is identified as beta-sandwiches by CATH. To dump into pdb files, use Matt's format\_converter.

Analysis: Phi/psi angles in core/edge strand each. Electrostatic interactions among residues. Assign one beta-sheet between two beta-sheets that constitute one beta-sandwich as additional chain so that InterfaceAnalyzer can be used. Beta_sheet_capping_info. Amino acids distribution/kind. Topology candidate. Beta-capping. Chirality.

###StrandBundleFeatures

**Overview**

Function summary: Find all strands -\> Leave all pair of strands -\> Leave all pair of sheets

Function detail:

It generates smallest unit of beta-sandwiches that are input files of Tim's SEWING protocol.

After finding all beta strands in pdb files, leave all pair of beta strands (either parallel or anti-parallel) among them. Then leave all pair of beta sheets (which are constituted with 4 beta strands each). As it finds strands/sheets, it find only those that meet criteria specified in option. 'strand\_pairs' table and 'sandwich' table are created in a same schema respectively.

**Overview**

This Feature Reporter writes out three tables corresponding to interfaces of a given pose.  Behind the scenes, it uses an updated version of the [[InterfaceAnalyzerMover]], which is also used by the [[InterfaceAnalyzer application | interface-analyzer]].  Without options, it will detect all interfaces of a given pose and report on all of them, even if no residues are in them. 

```xml
			<InterfaceFeatures scorefxn="(& Scorefxn name)" interface="(&string)", pack_separated="(&bool, false)" pack_together="(&bool, false)" dSASA_cutoff="(&real, 100)" compute_packstat="(&bool, true)" pack_together="true"/>
```


**XML Options**

-   scorefxn (& scorefxn string): Specify a scorefunction to use
-   interface(s) (&string) (default=All Interfaces):  Specify the interface as ChainsSide1_ChainsSide2 as in LH_A or a list of interfaces as LH_A,L_HB, etc.  
-   pack_separated (&bool) (default=false): Repack the detected interface residues during separation.
-   pack_together (&bool) (default=true): Repack the detected interface residues when they are together.
-   dSASA_cutoff (&real) (default=100): Buried Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) cutoff to ignore reporting most values.
-   compute_packstat (&bool) (default=true): Compute the PackStat (RosettaHoles 1.0) value of the interface?  Typically it takes a tiny bit more time.  Sometimes packstat is buggy.  If you are having errors in packstat, try switching this off.

##PoseConformationFeatures

**Overview**

The PoseConformationFeatures reporter measures the conformation level information in a Pose. Together with the ProteinResidueConformationFeatures, the atomic coordinates can be reconstructed. To facilitate creating poses from conformation structure data stored in the features database, PoseConformationFeatures has a *load\_into\_pose* method.

-   **pose\_conformations** : This table stores information about sequence of residues in the conformation.
	-   *annotated\_sequence* : The [annotated sequence](Glossary#annotatedsequence) string of residue types that make up the conformation
    -   *total\_residue* : The number of residues in the conformation
    -   *fullatom* : The ResidueTypeSet is *FA\_STANDARD* if true, and *CENTROID* if false.

**Tables**

<!-- -->

            fullatom BOOLEAN,
            FOREIGN KEY (struct_id) REFERENCES structures (struct_id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);

-   **fold\_trees** : The fold tree specifies a graph of how the residues are attached together. If the residues are thought of as vertices, each row in the *fold\_trees* table specifies a directed edge.
    -   *(start\_res, start\_atom)* : The initial residue and the attachment atom within the residue
    -   *(end\_res, end\_atom)* : The terminal residue and the attachment atom with the residue
    -   *label* : -2 if it is a *CHEMICAL* edge, -1 if is a *PEPTIDE* edge, and 1, 2, ... is a *JUMP* attachment. The geometry of the *JUMP* attachments is stored in the *jumps* table.
    -   *keep\_stub\_in\_residue* : For completeness, the option to keep stub in residue is stored.

            keep_stub_in_residue BOOLEAN,
            FOREIGN KEY (struct_id) REFERENCES structures (struct_id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);

-   **jumps** : Each *JUMP* edge in the fold tree is specified by a coordinate transformation, which is encoded in the *jumps* table.
    -   *jump\_id* : The canonical ordering of jumps in a conformation.
    -   {x,y,z}{x,y,z}: coordinates of the rotation matrix
    -   {x,y,z}: coordinates of the translation vector

-   **chain\_endings** : The conformation is broken into chemically bonded chains, which are identified by the chain endings. Note: If there are *n* chains, then there are *n-1* chain\_endings.
    -   *end\_pos* : The last sequence position in the conformation of a chain.

##RadiusOfGyrationFeatures

**Overview**

Measure the radius of gyration for each structure. The radius of gyration measure of how compact a structure is in O(n). It is the expected displacement of mass from the center of mass. The Wikipedia page is has some [information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_gyration) . Also see, Lobanov MY, Bogatyreva NS, Galzitskaya OV. [Radius of gyration as an indicator of protein structure compactness](https://doi.org/10.1134/S0026893308040195) . Molecular Biology. 2008;42(4):623-628.

-   **radius\_of\_gyration** :
    -   *radius\_of\_gyration* : Let *C* be the center of mass and *ri* be the position of residue *i'* th of *n* residues, then the radius of gyration is defined to be *Rg = SQRT{SUM\_{ri}(ri-C)\^2/(n-1)}* . Note: the normalizing factor is *n-1* to be consistent with r++. Atoms with variant type "REPLONLY" are ignored.

##SecondaryStructureSegmentFeatures

**Overview**
Report continuous segments of secondary structure. DSSP is used to define secondary structure, but simplified to be simply H, E, and L (all DSSP codes other than H and E). Due to this simplification of DSSP codes, the dssp column is NOT a foreign key to the dssp\_codes table.

##StructureFeatures

**Overview**

A structure is a group of spatially organized residues. The definition corresponds with a Pose in Rosetta. Unfortunately in Rosetta there is not a well defined way to identify a Pose. For the purposes of the the features database, each structure is assigned a unique struct\_id. To facilitate connecting structures in the database with structures in structures Rosetta, the tag field is unique.

-   **structures** : Identify the structures in the features database
    -   *tag* : The tag identifies the structure in Rosetta. The following locations are searched in order.
        1.  *pose.pdb\_info()-\>name()*
        2.  *pose.data().get(JOBDIST\_OUTPUT\_TAG)*
        3.  *JobDistributor::get\_instance()-\>current\_job()-\>input\_tag()*
