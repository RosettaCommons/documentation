PairFeatures
------------

The PairFeatures reporter measures the distances between residues.

-   **residue\_pairs** : The information stored here follows 'pair' EnergyMethod. The functional form for the pair EnergyMethod is described in [Simons, K.T., et al, Improved Recognition of Native-Like Protein Structures Using a Combination of Sequence-Dependent and Sequence-Independent Features of Proteins, (Proteins 1999).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10336385,)
    -   *resNum{1/2}* : the rosetta Residue indices of residues involved. Note, each pair is only recorded once and resNum1 \< resNum2.
    -   *res{1/2}\_10A\_neighbors* : Number of neighbors for each residue, used as a proxy for burial. (These columns are going to be moved to the **residue\_burial** table soon.)
    -   A *residue center* is represented by the actcoord, which is defined to be the average geometric center of of the ACT\_COORD\_ATOMS specified in the residue type params file for each residue type.
    -   *actcoord\_dist* : The cartesian distance between residue centers.
    -   *polymeric\_sequence\_dist* : The sequence distance between the residues. If either residue is not a *polymer* residue or if they are on different chains, this is -1.

The distances between pairs of atoms is an indicator of the packing of a structure. Since there are a large number of atom pairs, here, the information is summarized by atom pair distributions for each pair of atom types (Rosetta AtomType -\> element type). See AtomInResidueAtomInResiduePairFeatures for an alternative binning of atom-atom interactions.

-   **atom\_pairs** : Binned distribution of pairs of types of atoms
    -   *atom\_type* : The AtomType of the central atom. This is a subset of the AtomTypes defined in the full-atom AtomTypeSet atom\_properties.txt: *CAbb* , *CObb* , *OCbb* , *CNH2* , *COO* , *CH1* , *CH2* , *CH3* , *aroC* , *Nbb* , *Ntrp* , *Nhis* , *NH2O* , *Nlys* , *Narg* , *Npro* , *OH* , *ONH2* , *OOC* , *Oaro* , *Hpol* , *Hapo* , *Haro* , *HNbb* , *HOH* , and *S* .

AtomInResidueAtomInResiduePairFeatures
--------------------------------------

The distances between pairs of atoms is an indicator of the packing of a structure. Since there are a large number of atom pairs, here, the information is summarized by atom pair distributions for each pair of atom types (residue type + atom number). This is very similar in spirit to [Lu H, Skolnick J. A distance-dependent atomic knowledge-based potential for improved protein structure selection. Proteins. 2001;44(3):223-32](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11455595) , however, they use different distance bins. Here, (0,1], ..., (9,10] are used because they are easy. It may make sense to come up with a better binning upon further analysis. The molar fraction of atom types can be computed by joining with the Residues table since the types are unique within each residue type. If this is turns out to be too cumbersome, it may need to be pre-computed. **WARNING** : Currently, this generates an inordinate amount of data!!! \~250M per structure. **WARNING**

ProteinBackboneAtomAtomPairFeatures
-----------------------------------

The ProteinBackboneAtomAtomPairFeatures reporter measures all the atom pair distances between backbone atoms in pairs residues where the action coordinate is within 10A. This follows the analysis done in *Song Y, Tyka M, Leaver-Fay A, Thompson J, Baker D. Structure guided forcefield optimization. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics. 2011* . There, they looked at these distances for pairs of residues that form secondary structure.

HBondFeatures

The HBondFeatures reporter measures the geometry of hydrogen bonds. The most current reference is [Tanja Kortemme, Alexandre V. Morozov, David Baker, An Orientation-dependent Hydrogen Bonding Potential Improves Prediction of Specificity and Structure for Proteins and Protein-Protein Complexes, (JMB 2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00021-4) .

The HBondFeatures feature reporter takes the following options:

        <HBondFeatures scorefxn="(&scorefxn)" definition_type="(['energy', 'AHdist'])" definition_threshold="(&real)"/>

-   *scorefxn* : Use a the parameters in a defined score function to evaluate the hydrogen bonds
-   *definition\_type* , *definition\_threshold* : How should a hydrogen bond be defined? The default is a hydrogen bond is an interaction where the hbond energy is \< 0, ie `    energy   ` with a `    definition_threshold=0   `

The features associated with hydrogen bonding include

-   **hbond\_sites** : Conceptually these are positively and negatively charged functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds.
    -   *atmNum* :For donor functional groups, atmNum is the atom number of the polar hydrogen. For acceptor functional groups, atmNum is the atom number of an acceptor atom.
    -   *HBChemType* : The HBChemType string corresponding to an HBAccChemType or HBDonChemType depending on if the site is a donor or acceptor.

OrbitalFeatures
---------------

The OrbitalFeatures stores information about chemical interactions involving orbitals. Orbitals are atomically localized electrons that can form weak, orientation dependent interactions with polar and aromatic functional groups and other orbitals. Orbital geometry are defined in the residue type sets in the database. Following the orbitals score term, orbitals are defines between residues where the action center is at most 11A apart.

-   **HPOL\_orbital** : Interactions between orbitals and polar hydrogens. Intra-residue interactions are excluded.
    -   *polar hydrogens* : Polar hydrogens are identified by *res2.Hpos\_polar\_sc()*
    -   *orbName1* : This is like *LP10* and is the second column of the ORBITALS tag in the residue parameter files.
    -   *dist* : This is the distance between the orbital and the polar hydrogen
    -   *angle* : This is the cosine of the angle defined by the atom the orbital is attached to, the orbital and the polar hydrogen.

SaltBridgeFeatures
------------------

The SaltBridgeFeatures represent salt bridges and related interactions following the definition in:

﻿Donald JE, Kulp DW, DeGrado WF. Salt bridges: Geometrically specific, designable interactions. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics. 2010:n/a-n/a. Available at: [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/prot.22927](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/prot.22927) [Accessed November 14, 2010].

-   **salt\_bridges** : A row representes the center of an oxygen of the acceptor group ( *ASN* , *ASN* , *GLN* , *GLU* ) being within 6A of the center of the donor group ( *HIS* , *LYS* , *ARG* ). Note: the center of *HIS* is the midpoint between the ring nitrogens.
    -   *psi* : The angle of the oxygen around the donor group [-180, 180)
    -   *theta* : Angle out of the oxygen of donor group plane
    -   *rho* : Distance between the center of the donor group to the oxygen.
    -   *orbital* : *syn* or *anti* , the orbital of acceptor oxygen (based on the torsional angle about the acceptor-acceptor base bond).

            PRIMARY KEY(struct_id, don_resNum, acc_id));

ChargeChargeFeatures
--------------------

The ChargeChargeFeatures represent interactions between charged groups in molecular conformations. The primary interaction is through the Coulomb potential, which is proportional to q1\*q2/R\^2. However, because the charge is not always centered at the atom, and the groups can shield the interaction, it is important to measure the angles as well. For each charged site, there are three atoms defined based on the hbond\_site\_atoms table: q1 = atm, B1 = base, C1 = bbase, and similarly for q2.

-   **charge\_charge\_pair** : A row represents two charged polar group: ( *ASP* , *GLU* , *LYS* , *ARG* , *HIS* ) within 8A.
    -   *q{1,2}\_charge* : If it is a donor, then 1, if it is an acceptor then -1
    -   *B1q1q2\_angle* : The bond angle at q1 formed by B1 and q2
    -   *B2q2q1\_angle* : The bond angle at q2 formed by B2 and q1
    -   *q1q2\_distance* : The distance between the q1 and q2 atoms
    -   *B1q1\_torsion* : The torsion angle defined by C1-B1-q1-q2
    -   *B2q2\_torsion* : The torsion angle defined by C2-B2-q2-q1

LoopAnchorFeatures
------------------

        <LoopAnchorFeatures min_loop_length="5" max_loop_length="7"/>

This reporter scans all available windows of a specified number of residues and calculates the translation and rotation to optimally superimpose the landing onto the takeoff of the loop. The translation and rotation data can then be used to compare different "classes" of loop anchors.

-   **min\_loop\_length** : The minimum span of residues to compute the translation and rotation on.
-   **max\_loop\_length** : The maximum span of residues to compute the translation and rotation on.
