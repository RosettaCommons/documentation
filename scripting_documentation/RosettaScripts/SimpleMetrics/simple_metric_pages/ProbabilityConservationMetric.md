## ProbabilityConservationMetric

[[include:simple_metric_ProbabilityConservationMetric_type]]

### General description
A metric for calculating the conservation of a position given some predicted probabilities (using the relative Shannon Entropy). The returned value is between 0 (no conservation, all amino acids are equally likely) to 1 (fully conserved, only one amino acid is predicted). This metric alone does not require compilation with `extras=tensorflow,torch` but the model predictions that are typically input do. See [[Building Rosetta with TensorFlow and PyTorch]] for the compilation setup.


### Example
This example predicts the amino acid probabilities for chain A of our protein using ProteinMPNN and then calculates the conservation from them. Additionally it uses the `metric_to_bfactor` option of the [[RunSimpleMetrics]] mover which enables easy visualization of the values in ChimeraX/PyMol.
