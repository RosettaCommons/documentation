## ConstraintsMetric

The ConstraintsMetric provides a summary of all of the constraints in a pose or pose region selected by a residue
selector.  The summary is formatted as (non-enzdes) [[constraints file|constraint-file]] constraints, and can be copied
into a .cst file directly for use with the [[ConstraintSetMover]], for example.  This metric is intended as a replacement
for the older [[CstInfoMover]].
