# SimpleMetrics
*Back to main [[RosettaScripts|RosettaScripts]] page.*

SimpleMetrics are a new way to do analysis and data reporting in RosettaScripts, and have replaced the old Filter system for that purpose. SimpleMetrics can be run at different points in a protocol, such as before and after a particular mover or set of movers. They are declared in the `<SIMPLE_METRICS>` block of RosettaScripts and are available in Rosetta versions after April 10th, 2018. 

**Please cite:** [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462000) if you use SimpleMetrics. 

There are two ways of outputting the data calculated by SimpleMetrics to a scorefile. The first and most flexible is with the [[RunSimpleMetrics]] mover. See the documentation page for [[RunSimpleMetrics]] for more on the syntax of how to include it in your protocol.

The other (available after Oct 15th, 2021) is to use the `metrics` option in the [[PROTOCOLS|RosettaScripts#rosettascript-sections_protocols]] section. This option takes a comma-separated list of metric names (previously defined in the SIMPLE_METRICS section) to apply at that point of the protocol and to report to the scorefile. By default, this approach uses the name of the metric as the output label, rather than the metric-specified custom types. You can specify a different output label using the `labels` option of the PROTOCOLS section (which also takes a comma-separated list). The label `-` is special-cased to give you the name of the metric you would otherwise get with RunSimpleMetrics. 

All SimpleMetrics can also be used as Filters, using the [[SimpleMetricFilter]].
 
Finally, all SimpleMetrics can also be used within the [[FeaturesReporter | Features-reporter-overview]] framework, to allow robust analysis into relational databases.  Please see [[SimpleMetricFeatures]] for more.

##Effective use of SimpleMetrics

### Summarizing/Calculating metrics

The [[ResidueSummaryMetric]] takes a [[PerResidueRealMetric | SimpleMetrics#PerResidueRealMetric]] and summarizes the data in various ways, such as the mean, sum, or the number of residues above, below, or equal to a certain value. This Metric is itself a [[RealMetric | SimpleMetrics#RealMetric]] and can be used as such in filters, features reporters, etc.

The [[CalculatorMetric]] is a RealMetric which can combine other RealMetrics with an arbitrary mathematical formula.

### Custom Types

Each SimpleMetric has a `custom_type` option.  This option gives an additional name to the data term when using [[RunSimpleMetrics]] or [[SimpleMetricFeatures]] (ex: output scoreterm becomes L1_total_energy and L2_total_energy in the example below). The benefit to this is that you can have multiple SimpleMetrics, all configured differently and using the `custom_type` option allows you to run them all in a single RunSimpleMetrics or SimpleMetricFeatures application.  

Ex:

```xml

	<TotalEnergyMetric name="E_L1" residue_selector="L1" custom_type="L1" />
	<TotalEnergyMetric name="E_L2" residue_selector="L2" custom_type="L2" />
	<TotalEnergyMetric name="E_CDRs" residue_selector="ALL" custom_type="cdrs"/>

  	. . .

	<RunSimpleMetrics name="cdr_metrics" metrics="E_L1,E_L2,E_CDRs" />

```

### Prefix/Suffix

[[RunSimpleMetrics]] and [[SimpleMetricFeatures]] have additional options for prefix and suffix.  Use this to run a set of SimpleMetrics at different points in your protocol, or begin to group sets of metrics into similar tags.  For example, before a mover you can set `prefix="pre_min"` and then you can have the same set of SimpleMetrics run afterward as `prefix="post_min"`.  

Ex:

```xml


<RunSimpleMetrics name="cdr_metrics_pre" metrics="E_L1,E_L2,E_CDRs" prefix="pre_min_"/>
<RunSimpleMetrics name="cdr_metrics_post" metrics="E_L1,E_L2,E_CDRs" prefix="post_min_"/>
	
 . . . 
  
<PROTOCOLS>
	<Add mover_name="cdr_metrics_pre"/>
	<Add mover_name="min_mover" />
	<Add mover_name="cdr_metrics_post" />
</PROTOCOLS>

```

###Metric Cacheing

Some calculations are expensive, such as the `DensityFitMetric`.  In order to reduce run time during a complex protocol, [[SimpleMetricFilter]],  [[SimpleMetricFeatures]], and the [[ResidueSummaryMetric]] can use cached data.  During the `RunSimpleMetrics` application, ALL data is stored within the pose and this can be used for filters and features using the `use_cached_data` option.  If a prefix/suffix was used during `RunSimpleMetrics`, this is needed here as well as the options `cache_prefix` and `cache_suffix`. Any pose-length changes are accounted for automatically using Vikram Mulligan's excellent reference pose functionality.  

Ex: 

```xml
<SimpleMetricFilter name="ss_filter" use_cached_data="1" cache_prefix="cached_"  metric="ss" match="LLLLLLLLLLL"  comparison_type="ne"/>
<SimpleMetricFilter name="rmsd_filter" use_cached_data="1" cache_prefix="cached_"  metric="rmsd" cutoff="0.5" comparison_type="lt" />
```

###SavePoseMover

One thing to be aware of is that the data calculated during [[RunSimpleMetrics]] is stored in the pose.  This means that if you calculate a bunch of data and switch to a different pose in the protocol while using the [[SavePoseMover]], the data will not be output.  A mover to copy this data into a new pose is in the works, but please be aware of this.
