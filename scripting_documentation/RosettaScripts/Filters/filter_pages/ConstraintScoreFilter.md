# ConstraintScore Filter
*Back to [[Filters|Filters-RosettaScripts]] page.*
## ConstraintScore

Computes the score of a specific set of constraints generated by Constraint Generators.  This filter makes a copy of the pose and clears all constraints from the copy. It then uses the provided Constraint Generators to generate a set of constraints, and scores the pose using a basic scorefunction.  This basic scorefunction consists only of constraint score terms.

The specified Constraint Generators must have been previously defined in an [[AddConstraints|AddConstraintsMover]].

```xml
<ConstraintScore name="(&string)" constraint_generator="('', &string)" threshold="(0 &Real)" />
```

-   **constraint_generators** - Names of constraint generators used to generate constraints. Constraint Generators specified here must have been previously defined in an [[AddConstraints|AddConstraintsMover]] mover.
-   **threshold** - If the computed constraint score is less than or equal to this value, the filter returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
