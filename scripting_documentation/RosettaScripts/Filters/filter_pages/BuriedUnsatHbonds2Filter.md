## BuriedUnsatHbonds2 

Calculate the number of buried unsatisfied H-bonds across a given interface. (Specifically, the difference in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen bonds in the bound state versus the bound state. This uses a different algorithm than the BuriedUnsatHbonds filter.  What the differences were not properly documented, unfortunately.)
