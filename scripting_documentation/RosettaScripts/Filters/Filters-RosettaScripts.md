#Filters (RosettaScripts)

[[Return to RosettaScripts|RosettaScripts]]

Each filter definition has the following format in the `FILTERS` block:

```xml
<FILTERS>
	<SomeFilterName name="&string" confidence="(1 &Real)" other_option=""/>
</FILTERS>
```

where "SomeFilterName" belongs to a predefined set of possible filters that the parser recognizes and are listed below, name is a unique identifier for this mover definition and then any number of parameters that the filter needs to be defined.

Filters can be run on arbitrary [[SimpleMetrics]], which will eventually replace some aspects of the Filter system.  See the special [[SimpleMetricFilter]] for using arbitrary metrics for filtering.

If confidence is 1.0, then the filter is evaluated as in predicate logic (T/F). If the value is less than 0.999, then the filter is evaluated as fuzzy, so that it will return True in (1.0 - confidence) fraction of times it is probed. This should be useful for cases in which experimental data are ambiguous or uncertain.

After the end of the protocols code block, the filters will be run _again_ to report the most up-to-date values to the pose. The run at the end can be avoided, while still retaining filtering, by appending the option: `report_at_end=“false”`.
