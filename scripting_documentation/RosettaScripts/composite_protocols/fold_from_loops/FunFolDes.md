# FunFolDes

The **FoldFromLoops (FFL)** protocol is a variant of the _grafting protocol_.  
The protocol is aimed towards the insertion of structural motifs with a high RMSD distance to the insertion region in the target scaffold.

This documentation refers to the full reimplementation of the protocol as **Funtional Protein and Design (FunFolDes)**, integrated as part of _RosettaScripts_. To learn about the first version of the protocol (**FFL**) as described in [Correia _et al._, 2014](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12966) see [apps/fold_from_loops]()

# Overview:

**FunFolDes** requires two input structures: one containing the **motif** or structural segment that we want to keep/transfer into a new protein and the **template** or the scaffold that will define the structure that will support the motif.  
Broadly, the steps that the protocol follows are (**M**-Mandatory, **R**-Recommended):  

1.  Extract constraints from the **template** (_R_).
2.  Generate structure-based fragments from the **template** (_M_).
3.  Unfold the **template** and attach it to the **motif** region (_M_).
4.  Perform _ab initio_ allowing movement in all the **template** regions but keeping the **motif** regions fixed (_M_).
5.  Design/Relax the final structure without allowing movement in the **motif** (_R_).

## Highlights
### Automatic fragment generation
Thanks to the use of the [[StructFragmentMover]], **FunFolDes** is capable to generate fragments _on the fly_ to guide the _ab initio_ folding. This fragments use mostly structural information (secondary structure and phi/psi angles) in order to guarantee that the conformation of the final designs will be similar to that of the **template** but also allowing the system to explore conformational variations to better fit the **motif**.

### Multi-segment motif
In **FunFolDes**, a **motif** can be composed of _one_ continuous or _multiple_ discontinuous segments, as long as the number of insertion points in the **template** is the same as the number of expected segments. The different segments will be kept in spatial correlation of each other exactly as they are found in the original **motif** structure input. This is achieved through the **FoldTree** definition and breaks in the sequence. Thus, this scenario requires for a loop closure protocol to be applied in order to close the final design. Although any loop closure protocol in Rosetta will do, the [[NubInitioLoopClosureMover]] is provided by the protocol. This particular mover is aware of the constraints imposed by **FunFolDes** and will automatically avoid non-allowed changes in the **motif** segments.

### Order independent
In multi-segment **motif**s, the individual segments do not need to be inserted into the **template** in the same sequence order as they are found in the **motif** source structure. As a matter of fact, as long as they come from the same structural source, they don't even need to belong to the same protein.

### Length independent
The **motif** segments don't need to be of the same sequence length as their insertion points. **FunFolDes** will fix constraints and fragments in order to adapt to the possible length change between the designs and the **template**.

### Folding with the binder
For binding **motif**s, the binder can be added to the _ab initio_ process, forcing the conformation of the designs not only to adapt to the **motif** but also to the binder, thus ensuring that there are no structural segments that can block the **motif**'s function.

### Label guided design
Due to the possibility of size change and to help guide the design/relax steps, **FunFolDes** uses a residue-label system similar to that of **[[MotifGraftMover]]** (plus some others):

|label|Function|Expected behaviour|
|-----|--------|------------------|
|**MOTIF**|Highlight the **motif** regions|None in itself|
|**TEMPLATE**|Marks the residues that come from the **template**|This residues are allowed _bb/chi_ movement and design|
|**HOTSPOT**|Residues in the **motif** that are considered _key_|This residues can **not** move or be design|
|**COLDSPOT**|Residues in the **motif** that are not _key_|This residues have _chi_ movement and can be designed|
|**FLEXIBLE**|Residues in the edges of the **motif** that are allowed to move|This residues have _bb/chi_ movement but are **not** allowed to design|
|**CONTEXT**|Residues belonging to the target binder (if any)|This residues are **not** allowed to move or design|

The behaviour attached to each of this labels is **fixed** during the _folding process_ (performed by [[NubInitioMover]]) and the _loop closure_ (done by [[NubInitioLoopClosureMover]]), but it can be tweaked in any other part of the process by the user.

### Extra informative silent files
The **FunFolDes** protocol adds several remarks to the silent file output in order to facilitate the reload of the data in new scripts while keeping the protocol's conditions. Amongst them:

* **REMARK LABELS:** All residue label assignation are saved to file. They can be reloaded with **[[DisplayPoseLabelsMover]]**.
* **REMARK WORKING_FOLDTREE:** The working _FoldTree_ necessary to keep the **motif** segments in place is also saved. It can be loaded back with **[[AtomTreeMover]]**'s _from_remark_ option.
* **REMARK POST_NUBINITIO_SEQ:** As there is the possibility to run cycles of design on the sequence just after folding, the sequence at that state is saved, allowing an easier trackback of the design/relax process.

# Known caveats

1.  It is imperative to make sure that the **template** Pose is a **single chain** structure. Neither the generation of fragments, nor the _ab initio_ process allow for multiple movable chains.
2.  Due to the use of labels, the easiest way to guide control the protocol after folding is through the use of the  [[ResiduePDBInfoHasLabel|ResidueSelectors#residueselectors_conformation-dependent-residue-selectors_residuepdbinfohaslabel]] residue selector. To guide the MoveMap, one can then use **MoveMapFactory** to generate [[ResidueSelectors]]-based Movemaps. Right now, not all Movers that can work with MoveMaps can work with the MoveMapFactory. For those that can work with named MoveMaps, the [[MoveMapFactoryToNamedMoveMapMover]] can help.

# Main Components

* **[[NubInitioMover]]:** _[nub](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nub) inito_ refers to the _ab initio_ process around a central point of a protein; in this case, the **motif**. This process is the key differentiating element of the **FunFolDes** protocol, and this mover is its main component. The Mover is assigned with the tasks of (a) obtaining the **motif** from the structure source, (b) unfolding the **template** and attach it to the **motif**'s edges, (c) fold the new structure and (d) evaluate the viability of the obtained folded protein to move forward through the process.
* **[[NubInitioLoopClosureMover]]:** When working with multi-segment **motif**s, this mover is able to ensure a final closed structure without affecting residues from the **motif** in any unexpected way. Ideally, this should be the last mover to call before the evaluation part of the _script_. Closing the cutpoints in the structure before any backbone movement will most likely result in changes between the correlative positions of the different segments of the **motif**. The mover is "smart" enough to evaluate if it is needed. Thus, it is highly recommended to always add it and let it decide whether or not it has to try to close any chain break.
