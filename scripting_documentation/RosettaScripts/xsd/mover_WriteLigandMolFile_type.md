Output a V2000 mol file record containing all atoms of the specified ligand chain and all data stored in the current Job for each processed pose

```xml
<WriteLigandMolFile name="(&string;)" hash_file_names="(false &string;)"
        chain="(&string;)" directory="(&string;)" prefix="(&string;)"
        use_residue_name="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **hash_file_names**: Seems to be unused.
-   **chain**: (REQUIRED) The PDB chain ID of the ligand to be output.
-   **directory**: (REQUIRED) The directory all mol records will be output to. Directory will be created if it does not exist.
-   **prefix**: Set a file prefix for the output files.
-   **use_residue_name**: Use the residue name as part of the prefix for the output files.
