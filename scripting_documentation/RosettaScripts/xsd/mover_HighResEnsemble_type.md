```xml
<HighResEnsemble name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)"
        movemap_builder="(&string;)" final_move="(&string;)"

```

-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Score function to be used during docking
-   **chains**: (REQUIRED) Ligand chains, specified as the PDB chain IDs
-   **movemap_builder**: (REQUIRED) Name of a previously defined MoveMapBuilder for Docking phase.
-   **final_move**: (REQUIRED) Name of a previously defined MoveMapBuilder for Minimization phase.
-   **final_score**: (REQUIRED) Score function to be used during minimizing
-   **resfile**: Name (path to) the resfile.
-   **cycles**: Number of cycles to run.
-   **rosetta**: Use Rosetta scores as stand-in for experimental affinity (testing purposes)
-   **repack_every_Nth**: Perform side chain repacking every Nth cycle.
