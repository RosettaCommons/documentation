XRW TO DO

```xml
<SequenceRecovery name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        rate_threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        mutation_threshold="(100 &non_negative_integer;)"
        report_mutations="(0 &bool;)" verbose="(0 &bool;)"
        write2pdb="(0 &bool;)" reference_name="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **rate_threshold**: Rate of sequence recovery below which the filter fails
-   **mutation_threshold**: Raw number-of-mutations threshold above which the filter fails
-   **report_mutations**: Decide pass/fail based on the mutation threshold, not the rate threshold
-   **verbose**: Give a lot more logging output
-   **write2pdb**: Write each mutation as a string to the output PDB
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
