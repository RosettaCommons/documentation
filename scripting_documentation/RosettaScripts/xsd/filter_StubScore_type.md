This filter checks whether in the current configuration the scaffold is 'feeling' any of the hotspot stub constraints. This is useful for quick triaging of hopeless configuration. If used in conjunction with the Mover PlaceSimultaneously, don't bother setting flags -- the Mover will take care of it.

```xml
<StubScore name="(&string;)" chain_to_design="(2 &non_negative_integer;)"
        cb_force="(2 &non_negative_integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" >
    <StubSets >
        <Add stubfile="(&string;)" />
    </StubSets>
</StubScore>
```

-   **chain_to_design**: Chain that ought to be designed, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **cb_force**: Chain that ought to be designed, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter


Subtag **StubSets**:   A container for tags that indicate stubfiles to be loaded



Subtag **Add**:
