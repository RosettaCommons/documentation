-   **incorporate_matches_into_pose**: Incorporate the identified matches into the input pose
-   **residues_for_geomcsts**: A comma-separated list of residue selectors specifying residues to be used in geometric constraints


Subtag **MatcherConstraint**:   A complete description of an interaction pair to sample, including residue types, atoms to use as reference points to build coordinate frames, and one or Combinations.



Subtag **UpstreamResidue**:   Which atoms are constrained and what type of residue they are in

-   **atom1**: (REQUIRED) name of the first atom to use
-   **atom2**: name of the second atom to use
-   **atom3**: name of the third atom to use

Subtag **DownstreamResidue**:   Which atoms are constrained and what type of residue they are in

-   **atom1**: (REQUIRED) name of the first atom to use
-   **atom2**: name of the second atom to use
-   **atom3**: name of the third atom to use

Subtag **Combination**:   A fully-specified combinaiton of the six parameters needed to define an individual constraint. One or more Combinations can be specified in each MatcherConstraint tag.



Subtag **DistanceAB**:   

-   **x0**: (REQUIRED) x0 specifies the optimum distance x0 for the respective value.
-   **xtol**: (REQUIRED) xtol specifies the allowed tolerance of the value
-   **k**: (REQUIRED) force constant k, or the strength of the parameter. If x is the value of the constrained parameter, the score penalty applied will be: 0 if |x - x0| is less than xtol and k * ( |x - x0| - xtol ) otherwise. This is only relevant for enzdes, and is not used by the matcher.
-   **periodicity**: (REQUIRED) the periodicity of the constraint. For example, if x0 is 120 and per is 360, the constraint function will have a its minimum at 120 degrees. If x0 is 120 and per is 180, the constraint function will have two minima, one at 120 degrees and one at 300 degrees. If x0 is 120 and per is 120, the constraint function will have 3 minima, at 120, 240, and 360 degrees. In the case of distances, i.e. when specifying the DistanceAB parameter, this value has a special meaning: it indicates whether the constrained interaction is covalent or not with '1' meaning covalent and '0' meaning non-covalent. If the constraint is covalent, Rosetta will not evaluate the vdW term between DownstreamResidue:Atom1 and UpstreamResidue:Atom1 and their [1,3] neighbors.
-   **noSamples**: (REQUIRED) specifies how many samples the matcher, if using the classic matching algorithm ( see the matcher documentation ), will place between the x0 and x0 +- tol value. If the value in this column is n, the matcher will sample 2n+1 points for the respective parameter. Note: the number of samples is also influenced by the periodicity, with the matcher sampling around every x0.

Subtag **AngleA**:   

-   **x0**: (REQUIRED) x0 specifies the optimum distance x0 for the respective value.
-   **xtol**: (REQUIRED) xtol specifies the allowed tolerance of the value
