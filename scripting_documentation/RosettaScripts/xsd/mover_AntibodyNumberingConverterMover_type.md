Converts numbering schemes of an antibody, independent of AntibodyInfo. By default, works on a SINGLE antibody FAB with chains L and H, as the rest of Rosetta

```xml
<AntibodyNumberingConverterMover name="(&string;)"
        from="(&ab_numbering_schemes;)" to="(&ab_numbering_schemes;)" />
```

-   **from**: (REQUIRED) Current numbering scheme
-   **to**: (REQUIRED) Numbering scheme to be converter to
