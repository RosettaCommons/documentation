Perform a course random rotation  throughout all rotational degrees of freedom

```xml
<Rotate name="(&string;)" distribution="(&string;)"
        degrees="(&non_negative_integer;)" cycles="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        chain="(&string;)" tag_along_chains="(&string;)"
        grid_set="(default &string;)" />
```

-   **distribution**: (REQUIRED) Sampling distribution; Either "uniform" or "gaussian"
-   **degrees**: (REQUIRED) How degrees should be rotated around. Recommended=360
-   **cycles**: (REQUIRED) Number of cycles. Recommended: 1000
-   **chain**: Chain ID. MUST be a completely connected single chain.
-   **tag_along_chains**: Comma separated list of chains to be moved together with the rotating chain. E.g. metals or water.
-   **grid_set**: The ScoringGrid set to use for scoring the rotation. If no scoring grids (at all) are present in the XML, use a default classic grid.
