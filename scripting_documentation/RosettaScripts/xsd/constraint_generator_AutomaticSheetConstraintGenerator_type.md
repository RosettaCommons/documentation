---
Generates constraints between sheet residues putatively paired. Runs DSSP, so it might change a previously assignated secondary structure.

```xml
<AutomaticSheetConstraintGenerator name="(&string;)" sd="(2.000000 &real;)"
        distance="(6.100000 &real;)" />
```

-   **sd**: standar deviation
-   **distance**: Max distance to consider two residues paired
