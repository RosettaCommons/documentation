A filter that filters based on some named float-valued property measured by an EnsembleMetric.  Note that the value produced by the EnsembleMetric is based on an ensemble generated earlier in the protocol, presumably from the pose on which we are currently filtering.

```xml
<EnsembleFilter name="(&string;)" ensemble_metric="(&string;)"
        named_value="(&string;)" threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        filter_acceptance_mode="(less_than_or_equal &string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **ensemble_metric**: (REQUIRED) A previously-defined EnsembleMetric that produces at least one floating-point value.  This filter will filter a pose based on that value.
-   **named_value**: (REQUIRED) A named floating-point value produced by the EnsembleMetric, on which this filter will filter.
-   **threshold**: The threshold for rejecting a pose.
-   **filter_acceptance_mode**: The criterion for ACCEPTING a pose.  For instance, if the value returned by the ensemble metric is greater than the threshold, and the mode is 'less_than_or_equal' (the default mode), then the pose is rejected.  Allowed modes are: 'greater_than', 'less_than', 'greater_than_or_equal', 'less_than_or_equal', 'equal', and 'not_equal'.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
