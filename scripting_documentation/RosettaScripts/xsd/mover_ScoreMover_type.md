This Mover applies the scorefunction to your pose

```xml
<ScoreMover name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" verbose="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Score function to use when scoring this pose. Must be previously defined in the DataMap. Otherwise, we use the default scorefunction.
-   **verbose**: boolean controls a bunch of extra output - pose.energies.show() and something called a jd2:ScoreMap
