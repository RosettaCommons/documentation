```

-   **glycosylation**: String specifying the glycosylation to add to this pose (IUPAC Glycan String) (or a file name containing the glycosylation with a .iupac name)
-   **glycosylations**: String or file name specifying multiple possible glycosylations to add to this pose (IUPAC Glycan String) (or a file name containing the glycosylation with a .iupac name) (will be sampled randomly
-   **position**: Position to add glycosylation
-   **positions**: Positions to add glycosylations
-   **weights**: Sampling weights corresponding to the provided set of glycans
-   **strip_existing**: Strip existing glycosylations from the pose
-   **ref_pose_name**: Name of saved reference pose
-   **idealize_glycosylation**: Idealize glycosylations on the pose?
-   **residue_selector**: . The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
