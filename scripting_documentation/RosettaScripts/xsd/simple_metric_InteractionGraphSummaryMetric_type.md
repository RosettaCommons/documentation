A metric for writing out a description of the Rosetta-calculated interaction graph, which can be read in by external annealers or optimizers.

```xml
<InteractionGraphSummaryMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        skip_pose_reconstruction_info="(false &bool;)" filename="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **skip_pose_reconstruction_info**: If true, then this metric only stores a summary of the interaction graph.  If false (the default), then it stores both the interaction graph summary and full information for reconstructing the pose.  False by default.
-   **filename**: If this value is not empty, we will dump the IG summary to a file during calculation and simply return the filename as the return string. This results in a large amount of information being written directly to disk by each process. This will perform variable substituion on the "{rand}" substring such that "path/to/{rand}.txt" will result in something like "path/to/5748295.txt". The number will be different for each call so you can re-use the same metric without overwriting previous results.
