```

-   **symm_file**: Symmetry definition file if pose symmetric. hack for now
-   **attachment_termini**: termini to  attach to, can be c_term or n_term
-   **chain**: chain
-   **overlap_length**: length of overlap between the two structures
-   **overlap_rmsd**: How similiar the structures must be
-   **overlap_scan_range_cmdLine_pose**: how far in from the term to scan on the cmdLine input pose
-   **overlap_scan_range_xml_pose**: how far in from the term to scan on the xml input pose
-   **attach_pdb**: (REQUIRED) the pdb to be attached, this is the pdb that moves
-   **design_range**: distance from attachment and distance between new interacting residues allowed to design
-   **packing_range**: distance from designable_residues allowed to pack
-   **detect_disulf_before_pack**: detects disulfides before repacking, be sure to elimate them first with -detect_disulf false flag
-   **do_minimize**: Perform energy minimization
-   **no_design_label**: residues to not design or pack
-   **duplicate_rmsd_pose_threshold**: if poses are the same length they are eliminated if the rmsd check
-   **init_overlap_sequence**: where to take the overlap sequence from input_pose, xml_pose, or both which takes from closest element on a different SS.
-   **scorefxn**: Score function used for packing and design.
-   **output_only_first**: only does minimization on the first overlap and outputs
-   **output_overlap_positions**: outputs overlap positions
-   **do_design**: Perform design on sequence
-   **clash_threshold**: score0 clash threshold
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
