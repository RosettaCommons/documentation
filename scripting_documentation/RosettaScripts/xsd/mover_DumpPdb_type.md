Dumps a pdb. Recommended ONLY for debugging as you can't change the name of the file during a run, although if tag_time is true a timestamp with second resolution will be added to the filename, allowing for a limited amount of multi-dumping. If scorefxn is specified, a scored pdb will be dumped.

```xml
<DumpPdb name="(&string;)" fname="(dump.pdb &string;)"
        use_pose_name="(0 &bool;)" tag_time="(false &bool;)" dir="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **fname**: Filename of dumped PDB.  If PDBInfo is present, we will also append the pdb name.
-   **use_pose_name**: Use the original filename of the pose in the final name as fname+'_'+pose_name
-   **tag_time**: If true, adds timestamp to name of pdb file.
-   **dir**: Any directory to give.  Will use this and fname as the final name.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
