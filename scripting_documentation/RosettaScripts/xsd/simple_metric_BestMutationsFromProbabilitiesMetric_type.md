A CompositeRealMetric for calculating the mutations with the highest delta_probability to the current residues from a PerResidueProbabilitiesMetric. Outputs in the format Mutation-Position-Current, delta_value (e.g. D10A, 0.8)

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **metric**: (REQUIRED) A PerResidueProbabilitiesMetric to calculate the probability delta between the current amino acids and the most likely ones.
-   **max_mutations**: The maximum amount of mutations that will be returned (Default=10).
-   **delta_cutoff**: The cutoff for the delta in probability that will be reported. Default is 0 meaning at least as likely as the current residue
-   **use_cached_data**: Use any data stored in the datacache that matches the set metrics name (and any prefix/suffix.)  Data is stored during a SimpleMetric's apply function, which is called during RunSimpleMetrics
-   **cache_prefix**: Any prefix used during apply (RunSimpleMetrics), that we will match on if use_cache is true
-   **cache_suffix**: Any suffix used during apply (RunSimpleMetrics), that we will match on if use_cache is true
-   **fail_on_missing_cache**: If use_cached_data is True and cache is not found, should we fail?
