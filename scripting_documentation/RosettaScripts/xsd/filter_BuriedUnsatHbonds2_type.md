A filter for computing the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and/or acceptors, and discarding poses with too many.  This is the same thing that the BuriedUnsatHbonds filter does, but this filter does it a somewhat different way.  What the difference is has been lost to the mists of time.

```xml
<BuriedUnsatHbonds2 name="(&string;)" jump_number="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        cutoff="(20 &non_negative_integer;)" generous_hbonds="(true &bool;)"
        sasa_burial_cutoff="(0.01 &real;)" AHD_cutoff="(120 &real;)"
        dist_cutoff="(3.0 &real;)" hxl_dist_cutoff="(3.5 &real;)"
        sulph_dist_cutoff="(3.3 &real;)" metal_dist_cutoff="(2.7 &real;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **jump_number**: Jump, numbered sequentially from 1, that defines the interface
-   **cutoff**: Upper threshold beyond which the filter fails
-   **generous_hbonds**: Use a generous definition of H-bonds
-   **sasa_burial_cutoff**: SASA threshold to define residue burial
-   **AHD_cutoff**: Cutoff for AHD angle, in degrees, to define a hydrogen bond
-   **dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond
-   **hxl_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a hydroxyl
-   **sulph_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a sulfur
-   **metal_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a metal
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
