-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **use_cached_QM_energy**: If true, we first check the pose for a previous QM energy calculation that isn't stale (i.e. the pose hasn't changed) and which used the same level of theory.  The result of that is retrieved if possible, and a new QM calculation performed only if we don't already have a QM result.  If false, we always redo the QM energy calculation.  True by default to avoid unnecessarily repeated computations.
-   **gamess_path**: Path to GAMESS rungms executable (not including executable name).  If not specified, defaults to path set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:GAMESS_path option.
-   **gamess_executable_version**: GAMESS executable version.  Typically, this is a two-digit string, like 00 or 01.  If not specified, this defaults to the executable version specified on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:GAMESS_executable_version option.
-   **gamess_memory_megabytes**: The amount of memory, in megabytes, that each GAMESS process is allowed to use.  Defaults to 8,192 megabytes, or whatever is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:GAMESS_memory_megabytes commandline flag.

-   **gamess_processes_per_node**: The number of GAMESS MPI processes to launch per node per calling Rosetta thread or process.  Use 0 to launch one GAMESS MPI process per hardware thread on the node.  Only used if MPI build of GAMESS is used.  If not specified, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:GAMESS_processes_per_node commandline flag.
-   **use_gamess_mpi**: If true, the MPI build of GAMESS will be used (which requires a value for gamess processes per node).  If not specified, defaults to the commandline setting, based on whether the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:GAMESS_processes_per_node option is provided.

-   **gamess_qm_energy_file_prefix**: The prefix to use for temporary files written by the gamess_qm_energy energy method.  Generally, one needn't change this, but it can be useful if one has many instances of Rosetta running on the same system and using the same GAMESS scratch directory or GAMESS supplemental output directory.  If not specified, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_qm_energy_file_prefix commandline flag.
-   **gamess_hybrid_molecular_orbital_file**: The path and filename of the GAMESS HMOs.txt file.  This is only used for fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations.  This can be a relative path from the directory that contains the rungms executable or an absolute path.  If not specified, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_hybrid_molecular_orbital_file commandline flag (and rarely needs to be changed).
-   **gamess_verbosity**: The overall verbosity level for the GAMESS output log.  Allowed options are 'maximal', 'normal', and 'minimal', and these correspond to NPRINT=9, NPRINT=7, and NPRINT=-5, respectively, in the $CONTRL block of the GAMESS input file.

If not specified, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:default_electron_correlation_treatment flag.
-   **max_scf_iterations**: The number of self-consistent field iteration cycles.  A setting of 0 (the default) uses the GAMESS default (which is 30 in most circumstances).

Only used for FMO calculations.  If not specified, defaults to whatever is specified on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_hybrid_molecular_orbital flag.
-   **symmetry**: The symmetry expected by the gamess_qm_energy energy term.  NONE can always be used, though for symmetric molecules, this makes the QM calculation less efficient than it could be.

The options 'normal', 'reduced', 'small', and 'minimal' correspond to NPRINT=0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively in the $FMOPRP group in the GAMESS input file.  If not specified, defaults to whatever is specified on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:fmo_verbosity option.
-   **gamess_qm_energy_geo_opt**: Should the gamess_qm_energy scoreterm geometry-optimize the input pose before returning a final score?  Note that if this option is used, the optimized geometry is NOT returned; only the score.  This is also much slower.  If not specied, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_qm_energy_geo_opt flag.
-   **error_on_nonideal_bond_length_after_opt**: If true, Rosetta will throw an error if a GAMESS geometry optimization breaks a covalent bond (results in nonideal bond lengths over or under a threshold).  If not specied, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_error_on_nonideal_bond_length_after_opt flag.
-   **nonideal_bond_length_fract_threshold**: The fractional threshold for detecting nonideal bond lenghts.  For example, if set to 0.35, Rosetta throws an error if any bond is detected that is 35% longer or shorter than ideal after GAMESS geometry optimization.  If not specied, defaults to what is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_nonideal_bond_length_fract_threshold flag.

-   **h_bond_length_constraint_force**: If 'gamess_constrain_h_bond_lengths' is true and this flag is set, set the GAMESS FHMCON constraint force (kcal/mol) to this value. If not specified, defaults to whatever is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mechanics:GAMESS:gamess_geo_opt_h_bond_length_constraint_force.
-   **freeze_atoms_cart**: List of atom indices to be frozen during geometry optimization; set the GAMESS IFREEZ option to freeze an atom in Cartesian space; incompatible with NZVAR greater than 0 because the constraint is in Cartesian space; default behavior is to not freeze any atoms
-   **freeze_atoms_by_res_cart**: Atoms given in the format 'ResNum.AtomName' to be frozen during geometry optimization; set the GAMESS IFREEZ option to freeze an atom in Cartesian space; incompatible with NZVAR greater than 0 because the constraint is in Cartesian space; default behavior is to not freeze any atoms

This parameter (equivalent to NDFTB in a GAMESS input file) determines how many terms to use.  Defaults to whatever is set on the commandline with -quantum_mehanics:GAMESS:dftb:gamess_dftb_taylor_expansion_order; can be set to 1, 2, or 3.
-   **use_dftb_long_range_correction**: This turns on the long range corretion to the DFTB semi-empirical method.  Note that this requires parameters optimized for the long-range correction.  Defaults to whatever is set on the commandline with -quantum_mehanics:GAMESS:dftb:gamess_use_dftb_long_range_correction.  This is equivalent to the LCDFTB option in a GAMESS input file.
-   **dftb_long_range_correction_parameter**: A configuration parameter for the DFTB long-range correction.  Only used if use_dftb_long_range_correction is set to true.  Defaults to whatever is set on the commandline with -quantum_mehanics:GAMESS:dftb:gamess_dftb_long_range_correction_parameter.  See the EMU option in the GAMESS documentation for details.

Defaults to whatever is set on the commandline with the -quantum_mehanics:GAMESS:dftb:gamess_dftb_dispersion_model option.  See the DISP option in the GAMESS documentation for details.
-   **dftb_parameters_directory**: The directory (relative to the GAMESS_path/auxdata/DFTB/ directory) in which DFTB parameters are found.  If not set, the commandline option -quantum_mehanics:GAMESS:dftb:gamess_dftb_parameters_directory is used.  If nothing is set here or on the commandline, this defaults to 3OB-3-1, which is suitable for Taylor expanson level 3 and aqueous solvent.  See the PARAM option in the GAMESS documentation for details.


Subtag **QMConfiguration**:   Defines options for quantum mechanics scoreterms in the scorefunction used when scoring with this metric.

-   **fmo_fragmentation_method**: The fragmentation method to use to divide a large pose into small fragments for fragment molecular orbital methods.  Defaults to carbon_carbon_favouring_residue_based_fragments.  Allowed options are: residue_based_fragments, and carbon_carbon_favouring_residue_based_fragments.
