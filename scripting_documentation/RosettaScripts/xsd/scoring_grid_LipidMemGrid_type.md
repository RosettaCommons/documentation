A scoring grid that accounts for lipid directionality in the membrane space.

```xml
<LipidMemGrid name="(&string;)" grid_name="(&string;)" lipid_atom="(&string;)"
        kbpot_file="(&string;)" mem_weight="(2.0 &real;)" weight="(&real;)" />
```

-   **grid_name**: The name used to insert the scoring grid into the GridSet.
-   **lipid_atom**: (REQUIRED) Lipid atom name used to represents the head group or tail group of the lipid. Example: For cholesterol the headgroup atom is O1 and the tail atom is C25
-   **kbpot_file**: (REQUIRED) Text file containing lipid z coordinate statistical potentials.
-   **mem_weight**: Multiply the LipidMemGrid score with this weight.
-   **weight**: (REQUIRED) XRW TO DO
