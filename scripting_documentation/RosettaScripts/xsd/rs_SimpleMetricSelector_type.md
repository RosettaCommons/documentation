---
Allows selecting residues based on a PerResidueRealMetric.

```xml
<SimpleMetricSelector name="(&string;)" metric="(&string;)"
        lower_bound="(&string;)" upper_bound="(&string;)"
        outside_bounds="(false &bool;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</SimpleMetricSelector>
```

-   **metric**: A PerResidueRealMetric that will be used to select residues.
-   **lower_bound**: The lowest value that will be considered "inside the bounds". Leaving this blank or not including it will have no lower_bound.
-   **upper_bound**: The highest value that will be considered "inside the bounds". Leaving this blank or not including it will have no upper_bound.
-   **outside_bounds**: Use this if you want to select residues below lower_bound and above upper_bound.


"Residue Selector Tag": Any of the [[ResidueSelectors]]
