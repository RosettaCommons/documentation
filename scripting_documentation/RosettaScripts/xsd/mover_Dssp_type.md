Calculate secondary structures based on dssp algorithm, and load the information onto Pose

```xml
<Dssp name="(&string;)" reduced_IG_as_L="(0 &integer;)"
        asu_only="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **reduced_IG_as_L**: if set to be 1, will convert IG from Dssp definition as L rather than H
-   **asu_only**: if true, only performs DSSP on asymmetric unit.
