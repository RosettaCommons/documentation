The mover samples new protein conformations in two steps: 1) Rigid-body perturbation of SSEs with optional dihedrals change through fragments insertion, 2) Fragments-based loops closure and modeling

```

-   **template_pose**: Template pose for restraints generation (optional)
-   **stage1_scorefunction**: Stage1 scorefunction
-   **stage2_scorefunction**: Stage2 scorefunction
-   **stage1_moves**: Number of  moves to apply in stage 1
-   **stage1_move_restoring_segs**: At this stage1 move, SSEs automatically calculated with DSSP will be restored. This option is useful to split stage1 sampling in domain movements followed by SSEs movements (optional)
-   **modify_segments**: comma separated list of SSEs to modify in the format segIndex-firstRes-lastRes. The list of DSSP-calculated SSEs is printed during runtime (optional)
-   **add_segments**: comma separated list of new SSEs (missing in the list) to add in the format firstRes-lastRes (optional)
-   **stage1_rigid_residues**: comma separated list of residue selectors that should collectively be treated as rigid bodies during stage 1 (optional)
-   **stage1_multi_sse_freq**: Frequency from 0 to 1 of simultaneous multi-SSE moves
-   **stage1_frag_freq**: Frequency from 0 to 1 of PDB-derived fragments insertion moves in stage1
-   **stage1_twist_freq**: Frequency from 0 to 1 of helical moves
-   **stage1_temperature**: Temperature used for Monte Carlo Metropolis criterion
-   **stage1_residues**: Residue selector to apply in stage1 (AUTO=detect automatically)
-   **stage2_residues**: Residue selector to apply in stage2 (AUTO=detect automatically)
-   **stage2_residues_no_dihedral_csts**: Residue selector on which dihedral constraints won't be applied in stage2
-   **rotation_stdev**: Rotation angle (standard deviation) applied to SSEs
-   **translation_stdev**: Translation distance (standard deviation) applied to SSEs
-   **stage1_minimization**: Minimize during stage 1 (default False)
-   **stage2_moves**: Number of moves to apply in stage 2
-   **stage2_segment_freq**: Frequency from 0 to 1 of segment insertion moves with segments derived from input conformation
-   **stage2_targgaps_freq**: Frequency from 0 to 1 of targeting chain-breaks, higher freq means less diversification of loop regions
-   **stage2_temperature**: Temperature used for Monte Carlo Metropolis criterion
-   **stage2_models**: number of models that will be generated in stage2. Models will differ only in the stage2 sampling (optional)
-   **frags3**: 3-mer fragment file for fragments insertion. Automatically calculated if no file is provided
-   **frags9**: 9-mer fragment file for fragments insertion. Automatically calculated if no file is provided
