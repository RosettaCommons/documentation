Determines mutated residues in current pose as compared to a reference pose

```xml
<Mutations name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)" rate_threshold="(0.0 &real;)"
        mutation_threshold="(100 &non_negative_integer;)"
        report_mutations="(0 &bool;)" verbose="(0 &bool;)" packable="(0 &bool;)"
        write2pdb="(0 &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **rate_threshold**: Lower cutoff for the acceptable recovery rate for a passing design. Will fail if actual rate is below this threshold.
-   **mutation_threshold**: Upper cutoff for the number of mutations for an acceptable design. Only matters if report_mutations is set to true.
-   **report_mutations**: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will act as a filter for the number of mutations rather than the rate.
-   **verbose**: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will output the mutated positions and identities to the tracer.
-   **packable**: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will also consider mutations at packable positions in addition to designable positions.
-   **write2pdb**: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will output the mutated positions and identities to the output pdb.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
