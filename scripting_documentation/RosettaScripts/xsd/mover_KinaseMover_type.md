Enzymatic mover to phosphorylate a pose

```xml
<KinaseMover name="(&string;)" species="(&string;)" enzyme_name="(&string;)"
        efficiency="(&real;)" perform_major_reaction_only="(&bool;)"
        perform_all_reactions="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **species**: Set the species name of this simulated enzyme.
-   **enzyme_name**: Set the specific name of this simulated enzyme.
-   **efficiency**: Directly set the efficiency of this enzyme, ignoring whatever is in the database.
-   **perform_major_reaction_only**: Set this EnzymaticMover to perform only its major reaction.
-   **perform_all_reactions**: Allow this EnzymaticMover to be promiscuous, performing a random transfer from among its possible co-substrates.
