```xml
<MakeStarTopology name="(&string;)"
        mode="(default &valid_make_star_topology_modes;)"
        restore="(false &bool;)" tag="(nulltag &string;)"
        reference_name="(&string;)" />
```

-   **mode**: Set up default or disconnected star topology?
-   **restore**: Apply the fold tree set up on a previous run of this mover to the pose?
-   **tag**: Name of a previously defined fold tree to be used in this mover. If the fold tree has not been defined, it will be set as the default fold tree.
-   **reference_name**: The saved pose to take the forldtree from if restoring without a prior save.
