Calculates holes value(?) and filters based upon topology

```xml
<Holes name="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        cmd="(XRW TO DO &string;)" threshold="(2.0 &real;)"
        exclude_bb_atoms="(false &bool;)" normalize_per_residue="(false &bool;)"
        normalize_per_atom="(false &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **residue_selector**: only calculate holes score for residues in residue_selector; The holes calculation is performed on the Pose as whole (ignoring the ResidueSelector), but the score that's reported is the sum of only the atoms in the residue selector.  The Holes score is a sum of individual atoms/residues anyway (technically PoseBalls), so by only reporting a specific selection, get location-specific data. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
-   **cmd**: expects you to use -holes::dalphaball
-   **threshold**: Threshold value for the filter
-   **exclude_bb_atoms**: don't include backbone (bb) atoms in residue selection (residue_selector case)
-   **normalize_per_residue**: for residue selector case, nomralize per residue
-   **normalize_per_atom**: for residue selector case, normalize per atom; defaults to true if residue_selector if normalize_per_atom and normalize_per_residue not explicitly defined by user
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
