Calculates the electrostatic similarity using APBS based on McCoy et al.

```xml
<ElectrostaticSimilarityMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        partially_solvated="(0 &bool;)" report_all_es="(0 &bool;)"
        residue_selector1="(&string;)" residue_selector2="(&string;)"
        use_native="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **partially_solvated**: If false, then fully solvated. When partially solvated, the other side of the pose is present but has 0 charge. If fully solvated, the other side of the pose is not present and solvent fills its place.
-   **report_all_es**: Do you want to see the sub correlations? (The normally reported values are the averages of interface 1 and 2)
-   **residue_selector1**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **residue_selector2**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **use_native**: Use the native if present on the cmd-line.
