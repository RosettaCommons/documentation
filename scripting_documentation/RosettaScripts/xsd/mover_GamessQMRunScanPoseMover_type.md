A quantum chemistry mover that increments atoms along a user-specified reaction coordinate and either (1) computes a single point energy calculation, or (2) performs a partial geometry optimization with reaction coordinate atoms fixed in Cartesian space, using the GAMESS quantum chemistry software package for the energy calculations and optimization. A scan that performs only single point energy calculations is referred to as a 'rigid scan', while a scan that performs a partial geometry optimization at each interval is referred to as a 'flexible scan'. If multiple scan points are provided, then the output structure will be selected based on several options: start, end, transition, lowest energy, or highest energy. Energies from each point of the scan will be output as individual score terms.

-   **scan_type**: "rigid" (default) - compute single point energy at each scan interval; "flexible" - perform geometry optimization at each fixed scan interval
-   **mover_name**: The QM geometry optimization mover whose execution is desired
-   **metric_name**: The QM energy metric whose execution is desired
-   **init_rc_from_original_coords**: If true then reset the pose coordinates to their original values before each reaction coordinate scan step; this causes subsequent geometry optimization to begin from the coordinates of the original pose, plus whatever perturbation is encoded in the reaction coordinate; if pose is not reset (i.e., 'false'), then each geometry optimization is initialized from the post-optimization coordinates of the last round, with the reaction coordinate scan applied in that context.
-   **dump_pdb_rc_pre_opt**: Dump the PDB of a pose with a modified reaction coordinate prior to optimization
-   **dump_pdb_rc_post_opt**: Dump the PDB of a pose with a modified reaction coordinate after optimization
-   **dump_pdb_directory**: Directory in which to dump pre- or post-optimization PDBs, if enabled. Defaults to current directory
-   **dry_run**: If true, run through the mover without performing any QM calculations; useful for dumping reaction coordinate PDB files


Subtag **ReactionCoordinatePath**:   

-   **path_function**: The collection of atomic motions that define the reaction coordinate path;currently, only the 'linear' path function is implemented.
-   **path_file**: The file specifying the reaction coordinate atomic start and end states and number of steps.
Lines beginning with '#', '!', '/', '//', or '///' are comment lines.
Uncommented lines are formatted as follows:
PATH_FUNC SET_NUMBER RESIDUE_NUMBER ATOM_NAME START_X START_Y START_Z END_X END_Y END_Z NUMBER_STEPS PATH_FUNC_PARAMS_FILE
PATH_FUNC: defines the functional form of the path connecting the start and end atom coordinates; must be specified in all capital letters; options right now are 'LINEAR'.
SET_NUMBER: tracks which atoms are moved together (i.e., which are in a set together); atoms in the same set must have the same NUMBER_STEPS
RESIDUE_NUMBER: residue number (1-indexed) containing the atom of interest
ATOM_NAME: the atom whose coordinates will be perturbed based on the specified path function and related data
START_X: the starting X coordinate
START_Y: the starting Y coordinate
START_Z: the starting Z coordinate
END_X: the ending X coordinate
END_Y: the ending Y coordinate
END_Z: the ending Z coordinate
NUMBER_STEPS: the number of steps, not the number of states; the discrete xyz coordinates after the initial start xyz coordinates and including the final xyz coordinates; in other words, if you specify 10 steps, then you will end with 11 total discrete states along this path of motion because the reaction coordinate is inclusive of the starting coordinates; for a simple 1D example, consider that for start_coord=0, end_coord=1, NUMBER_STEPS=5 with PATH_FUNC=LINEAR you will have the reaction coordinate of [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1], which is 6 states separated by 5 steps starting with the initial coordinate PATH_FUNC_PARAMS_FILE: file that specifies additional function parameters for path functions other than 'LINEAR'; not applicable to and ignored for PATH_FUNC=='LINEAR' Here is an example of a valid input line
LINEAR 0 2 H10 23.772 39.889 66.801 23.659 39.187 64.538 10
The path file may contain as many rows (corresponding to individual atoms) as needed; however, the current implementation will only read the first row (in progress).
-   **path_assembly**: Instructions for how to assemble multiple sets of atoms into one reaction coordinate. Complex reaction coordinates may involve multiple atoms moving alone or together either simultaneously, in sequence, combinatorially, or a combination of each. This behavior can be defined through use of SET_NUMBER entries in the 'path_file' and this 'path_assembly' string. Atoms sharing a SET_NUMBER are moved together; however, the behavior of multiple unique set numbers for different atoms is not defined in the 'path_file' - that is addressed with this flag by writing a list of SET_NUMBER values separated by commas and/or enclosed in brackets. Consider the following example: path_assembly='1,2,[3-4],5'. This says that the atoms belonging to SET_NUMBER 1 will be incremented along their reaction coordinate paths first. After that part of the scan is complete, SET_NUMBER 2 will be incremented along the path starting from the end state of SET_NUMBER 1 (note that rules from 'init_rc_from_original_coords' still apply). At the end of SET_NUMBER 2, the space given by combinatorial expansion of all pairwise discrete states of SET_NUMBER 3 and SET_NUMBER 4 will be sampled (so if there are 10 discrete states for SET_NUMBER 3 and 5 discrete states for SET_NUMBER 4 then this step will sample all 50 possible combinations). Finally, SET_NUMBER 5 will be sampled after completion of the previous combinatorial block, beginning from the final state of the previous block. Note also that the path assembly does not need to be written in numeric order (e.g., path_assembly='2,7,5' is valid even if there are additional set numbers in the path file).
-   **skip_n_initial_states**: The number of states to skip starting from the initial state after reaction coordinate discretization
-   **skip_n_final_states**: The number of states to skip starting from the final state after reaction coordinate discretization
