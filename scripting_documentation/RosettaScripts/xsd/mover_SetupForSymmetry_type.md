Given a symmetry definition file that describes configuration and scoring of a symmetric system, this mover 'symmetrizes' an asymmetric pose.

```xml
<SetupForSymmetry name="(&string;)" definition="(&string;)"
        preserve_datacache="(0 &bool;)" keep_pdb_info_labels="(0 &bool;)"
        symmetry_resource="(&string;)"
        set_global_symmetry_at_parsetime="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **definition**: The path and filename for a symmetry definition file. This is optional because you can also specify -symmetry:symmetry_definition {pathto/filename_symmetry_definition_file} on the command line.
-   **preserve_datacache**: If true, the datacache from the input asymmetric pose will be copied into the new symmetric pose. If false, the pose datacache will be cleared. Default is false for historical reasons.
-   **keep_pdb_info_labels**: If true, keep PDB Info labels from input pose.
-   **symmetry_resource**: The name for symmetry definition object created by the ResourceManager; this Resource must be declared in the RESOURCES block at the top of the protocol XML file
-   **set_global_symmetry_at_parsetime**: Should the -symmetry_definition flag be set globally by this mover at parse time.  The default (true) maintains compatibility with all protocols, but can cause problems if symmetry is set or changed partway through a protocol.
