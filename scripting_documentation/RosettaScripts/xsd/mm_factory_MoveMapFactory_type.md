A MoveMapFactory can be used to restrict conformational flexibility to a specific set of DOFs taking into account the conformation of the input Pose. It will construct a MoveMap, (or edit an existing MoveMap), making a series of modifications to it based on the instructions given. First it will make the highest-level modifications given by the attributes 'bb', 'chi', 'nu', 'branches', and 'jumps'; it will make these modifications to 'true' (enable) or 'false' (disable) if they are given in the Tag, but it will not make a modification if it is not given. (It is worth knowing that a default MoveMap says 'nothing is free to move' but that many Movers will use the MoveMapFactory to edit an existing MoveMap they have initialized with behaviors such as 'all backbones and sidechain dihedrals are free' so make sure to consult the documentation for the MoveMapFactory consumer you intend to use.) After it makes the highest-level modifications, it makes intermediate-level modifications specified by the sub-elements in the order they are provided. These are the Backbone, Chi, Nu, Branches, and Jumps tags (but the Backbone tag only when the 'bb_tor_index' attribute is absent). For each of these tags, a ResidueSelector is used to define a group of residues to operate on, and then those residues selected (i.e. whose values are marked 'true') will be operated on. The operation performed is specified by the 'enable' attribute of these sub-elements; if this attribute is not given, then the operation will be to enable that DOF. Residues that are not selected by the ResidueSelector are not operated on; if your intention is to disable flexibility for a set of residues, and these residues are already marked as flexible, it is not good enough to leave them out of a selection that enables a different set of residues. You will have to explicitly select those residues and then perform a disabling action on them. Finally, the lowest-level operations are performed. For now, this is the particular-backbone-dihedrals enable/disable actions for Backbone tag (i.e. when the 'bb_tor_index' attribute is provided). These lowest level operations happen last, but within the set of all lowest-level operations, they are performed in the order that they are provided; this is perhaps confusing.

</MoveMapFactory>
```

-   **bb**: Enable or disable movement for all backbone torsions.
-   **chi**: Enable or disable movement for all chi torsions.
-   **nu**: Enable or disable movement for all nu torsions.
-   **branches**: Enable or disable movement for all branch torsions.
-   **jumps**: Enable or disable movement for all jump DOFs.
-   **cartesian**: Set the MMF for specific cartesian overrides.  Currently is only used for glycans in order to maintain IUPAC nomenclature during moves


Subtag **Backbone**:   

-   **enable**: Enable this DOF? (false for disable)
-   **residue_selector**: (REQUIRED) The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object
-   **bb_tor_index**: If this option is set, then this element will apply to only a particular backbone index; e.g. 3. Indices that are out-of-bounds (e.g.'10' for a residue with 3 backbone dihedrals) have no effect

Subtag **Chi**:   

-   **enable**: Enable this DOF? (false for disable)
-   **residue_selector**: (REQUIRED) The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object

Subtag **Nu**:   

-   **enable**: Enable this DOF? (false for disable)
-   **residue_selector**: (REQUIRED) The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object

Subtag **Branches**:   

-   **enable**: Enable this DOF? (false for disable)
-   **residue_selector**: (REQUIRED) The name of the already defined ResidueSelector that will be used by this object

Subtag **Jumps**:   

-   **enable**: Enable this DOF? (false for disable)
-   **jump_selector**: (REQUIRED) The name of the already defined JumpSelector that will be used by this object
