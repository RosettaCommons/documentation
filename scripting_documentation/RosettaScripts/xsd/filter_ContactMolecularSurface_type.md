Calculates the contact molecular surface area on the target defined by the target_selector, and the area is weighted by the cloest distance between the target and the binder. The binder is defined by the binder residue selector

```xml
<ContactMolecularSurface name="(&string;)" min_interface="(0 &real;)"
        distance_weight="(1.0 &real;)" near_squared_size="(0.0 &real;)"
        verbose="(false &bool;)" quick="(false &bool;)"
        apolar_target="(false &bool;)" target_selector="(&string;)"
        binder_selector="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **min_interface**: The filter fails is the calculated interface area is less than the given value.
-   **distance_weight**: The weight factor of the cloest distance betweent the distance that is multiplied by the area by each surface dot.
-   **near_squared_size**: The weight factor of the cloest distance betweent the distance that is multiplied by the area by each surface dot.
-   **verbose**: If true, print extra calculation details to the tracer.
-   **quick**: If true, do a quicker, less accurate calculation by reducing the density.
-   **apolar_target**: Only look at non-polar atoms on the target side.
-   **target_selector**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **binder_selector**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
