```

-   **residue_selector**: residue selector that tells the filter to restrict the Unsat search to only those residues. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
-   **use_legacy_options**: revert to legacy options (equivalent to old, original BuriedUnsat Filter; WARNING! If this is true, will overwrite all other options
-   **generous_hbonds**: count all h-bonds (not just those scored by the default scorefxn in rosetta
-   **max_hbond_energy**: Max energy for an hbond to be accepted as making an hbond. This can go positive!!! Defaults to -score::hb_max_energy (which defaults to 0).
-   **use_vsasa**: use vsasa insteady of legacy sasa for burial calculation
-   **ignore_surface_res**: many polar atoms on surface atoms get flagged as buried unsat becuause they are occluded by a long sidechina (e.g. Lys or Arg) that could easily move out of the way; this option ignores surface residues, as deinfed by SASA (default) or sc_neighbors if use_sc_neighbors=true
-   **ignore_bb_heavy_unsats**: ignore bb heayy atom unsats when using hbnet-style behavior
-   **use_sc_neighbors**: use sc_neighbors insteady of SASA for burial calculations
-   **use_ddG_style**: perform ddG style calcation: the Unsats are calculated by subtracting all unsats in bound state from unbound state; this is how the original BuriedUnsatHBondsFilter works
-   **only_interface**: restrict unsat search only to interface residues; if true and more than one chain it's ignored
-   **print_out_info_to_pdb**: print all info to pdb file into addition to tracer
-   **jump_number**: The jump over which to evaluate the filter; only applies to use_ddG_style
-   **dalphaball_sasa**: Use DAlphaBall to calculate SASA.
-   **cutoff**: The upper threshold for counted buried unsat H-bonds, above which the filter fails
-   **probe_radius**: probe radius to use for SASA buriedness calculations; default is grabbed from sasa_calculator_probe_radius in options code, which defaults to 1.4
-   **burial_cutoff**: used to determine burial; deafault legacy SASA atomic_burial_cutoff is 0.3; default VSASA cutoff is 0.1; if use_sc_neighbors=true, default becomes 4.4 or can be user-specified to sc_neighbor cutoff that is desired
-   **probe_radius_apo**: If set greater than 0, use a different probe_radius for the apo phase of use_ddG_style.
-   **burial_cutoff_apo**: If set greater than 0, use a different burial_cutoff for the apo phase of use_ddG_style.
-   **residue_surface_cutoff**: cutoff to determine which residues are surface if ignore_surface_res=true; default is 45.0 for SASA, 20.0 for VSASA and 2.0 if use_sc_neighbors=true
-   **atomic_depth_selection**: Include only atoms past a certain depth. Depth is from edge of SASA surface to center of atom. Pose converted to poly-LEU before SASA surface calculation. -1 to disable.
-   **atomic_depth_probe_radius**: Probe radius for atomic_depth_selection. Set this high to exclude pores. Set this low to allow the SASA surface to enter pores.
-   **atomic_depth_resolution**: Resolution for atomic depth calculations.
-   **atomic_depth_apo_surface**: If set greater than 0, atoms must be less deep than this to be considered buried during ddG calculations.
-   **use_reporter_behavior**: report as filter score the type of unsat turned on; this is now TRUE by default
-   **use_hbnet_behavior**: no heavy unstas allowed (will return 9999); if no heavy unstas, will count Hpol unsats; FALSE by default; if set to true, will NOT use reporter behavior
-   **report_all_unsats**: report all unsats
-   **report_all_heavy_atom_unsats**: report all heavy atom unsats; IF ALL REORTER OPTIONS ARE FALSE, THIS BECOMES TRUE AND DEFAULT REPORTS ALL HEAVY UNSATS
-   **report_sc_heavy_atom_unsats**: report side chain heavy atom unsats
-   **report_bb_heavy_atom_unsats**: report back bone heavy atom unsats
-   **report_nonheavy_unsats**: report non heavy atom unsats
-   **report_heavy_acceptors_and_hpols**: report heavy atom acceptors and hpols
-   **atomic_depth_deeper_than**: If true, only atoms deeper than atomic_depth_selection are included. If false, only atoms less deep than atomic_depth_selection are included.
-   **atomic_depth_poly_leu**: Convert pose to poly-leu before calculating depth? Gives stable, sequence independent values that align with approximate_buried_unsat_penalty.
-   **is_ligand_residue**: If the selected residue is a ligand. Default: false.
-   **sym_dof_names**: For multicomponent symmetry: what jump(s) used for ddG-like separation. (From Dr. Bale: For multicomponent systems, one can simply pass the names of the sym_dofs that control the master jumps. For one component systems, jump can still be used.)  IF YOU DEFIN THIS OPTION, Will use ddG-style separation for the calulation; if you do not want this, pass a residue selector instead of defining symdofs.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
