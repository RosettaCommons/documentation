A ResidueSelector for carbohydrates and individual carbohydrate trees. Selects all Glycan residues if no option is given or the branch going out from the root residue. Selecting from root residues allows you to choose the whole glycan branch or only tips, etc.

```xml
<Glycan name="(&string;)" branch="(&string;)" branches="(&string;)"
        ref_pose_name="(&string;)" include_root="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **branch**: Set the residue to select from.  These can be the branch points of the glycans or carbohydrate residues from which to select the downstream branch from. Like the rest of a tree from a particular position.  That position could be the trunk or individual branches, which keep branching out. Pose (23) or PDB numbering (24A)
-   **branches**: Set the residues to select from. Separated by spaces or commas. These can be the branch points of the glycans or carbohydrate residues from which to select the downstream branch from. Like the rest of a tree from a particular position.  That position could be the trunk or individual branches, which keep branching out. Pose (23) or PDB numbering (24A)
-   **ref_pose_name**: If using a Reference Pose, set the name
-   **include_root**: Should we include the root (branch/branches) residues in our selection or just go from that?
