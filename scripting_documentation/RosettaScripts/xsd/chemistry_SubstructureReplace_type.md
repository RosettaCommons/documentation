Replace a given substructure of a ResidueType with another, grafting substituents.

```xml
<SubstructureReplace name="(&string;)" substructures="(&string;)"
        weight_by_property="(&string;)" distance_threshold="(&real;)"
        H_as_dummy="(0 &bool;)" V_as_dummy="(0 &bool;)" />
```

-   **substructures**: (REQUIRED) The name of the SDF file which contains the *aligned* substructures to swap.
-   **weight_by_property**: When randomly picking the substructure from the file, weight by the given property from the SDF
-   **distance_threshold**: When replacing, how far apart can two attachment point atoms be and still be considered the same point
-   **H_as_dummy**: If true, use hydrogens in the input file as attachment points
-   **V_as_dummy**: If true, use vanadium atoms in the input file as attachment points
