Replace a substituent on a given substructure of a ResidueType with another.

```xml
<SubstituentReplace name="(&string;)" templates="(&string;)"
        substituent="(&string;)" weight_by_property="(&string;)"
        H_as_dummy="(0 &bool;)" V_as_dummy="(0 &bool;)" />
```

-   **templates**: (REQUIRED) The name of the SDF file which contains the templates which define the substituents.
-   **substituent**: (REQUIRED) The name of the SDF file which contains the database of substituents to use in the replacement.
-   **weight_by_property**: When randomly picking the substructure from the file, weight by the given property from the SDF
-   **H_as_dummy**: If true, use hydrogens in the input file as attachment points
-   **V_as_dummy**: If true, use vanadium atoms in the input file as attachment points
