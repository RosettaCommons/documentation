slices up repeat proteins to miniproteins

```xml
<SliceToMiniProteinMover name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        max_length="(119 &non_negative_integer;)"
        min_sse_count="(4 &non_negative_integer;)"
        min_sse_length="(13 &non_negative_integer;)"
        ddg_ala_slice_score="(-5.0 &real;)" relax_mover="(&string;)"
        output_mode="(all &string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **max_length**: max length of miniprotein
-   **min_sse_count**: min secondary structure element count
-   **min_sse_length**: min secondary structure element length
-   **ddg_ala_slice_score**: energy when slicing up the miniprotein
-   **relax_mover**: Optionally define a mover which will be applied prior to computing the system energy in the unbound state.
-   **output_mode**: output mode, all,longest,best_ddg
-   **residue_selector**: name of a residue selector that specifies the subset allowed to be part of the miniprotein. Note. This segment must be contiguous. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
