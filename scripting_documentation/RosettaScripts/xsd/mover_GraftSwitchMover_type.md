Grafts a functional sequence onto the latch of a LOCKR type protein. Returns all threads where average degree of important residues is greater than the cutoff (defualt=6).  By default will find the c-terminal helix and set all positions as threadable.  Set n_term to true to find n-terminal helix instead.  Set start/end to define a custom range to begin threads.  Set selector to use a residue selector to define threadable residues and Rosetta will determine which positions can fit your sequence.

-   **selector**: Residue Selector defining residues that can be threaded onto.  Overrides default behavior and start/end if defined. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
-   **start**: Residue number defining the start of the threadable residue range.  Must be defined with 'end'. Overrides default behavior.
-   **end**: Residue number to end the range of residues to allow threading.
-   **n_term**: Default behaivor without setting start/end or selector is to find the c-terminal helix and set all positions designable.  Set to true if latch is on the n-terminus instead.
-   **any_order**: With multiple sequences, set to false if you want to maintain the order of sequences you've defined.  Useful if you need one seq closer to one terminus than the other.
-   **pack_neighbors**: Set to false if you do not want neighboring residues to repack during threading
-   **graft_on_latch_loop**: Set to false if you do not want the loop between the cage/latch to be threaded
-   **sequence**: Comma separated list of sequences to thread. A '-' indicates a gap where NATAA will be default
-   **important_residues**: A comma-separated list of residue numbers (1 corresponding to first residue in 'sequence') that must be buried/caged. Separate important residues for separate sequences with a '/' in order listed for the 'sequences' tag
-   **burial_cutoff**: Number of neighboring residues that determines extent of burial
-   **pack_min**: Do a final minimization and pack neighbors after threading
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
