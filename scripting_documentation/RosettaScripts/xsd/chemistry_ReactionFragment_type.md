Split a molecule in two based on a list of reactions, keeping on one portion.

```xml
<ReactionFragment name="(&string;)" reactions="(&string;)"
        keep_random="(0 &bool;)" keep_bigger="(0 &bool;)" keep_atom="(&string;)" />
```

-   **reactions**: (REQUIRED) The name of the file containing the SMARTS-based reactions to use, written in the synthetic direction.
-   **keep_random**: If true, keep a random reaction product (instead of the first).
-   **keep_bigger**: If true, keep the biggest reaction product
-   **keep_atom**: If set, keep the reaction product with the given object
