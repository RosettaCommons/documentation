Sets residue type constraints (SequenceProfileConstraint) on the pose according to the given profile and weight.

```xml
<FavorSequenceProfile name="(&string;)" weight="(1 &real;)"
        scorefxns="(&string;)" use_native="(&bool;)" use_fasta="(&bool;)"
        use_starting="(&bool;)" use_current="(&bool;)" pdbname="(&string;)"
        pssm="(&string;)" chain="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        scaling="(prob &favor_seqprof_scaling_type;)"
        matrix="(BLOSUM62 &string;)" exclude_resnums="(&string;)"
        reference_name="(&string;)" />
```

-   **weight**: Adjust the post-scaling strength of the constraints.
-   **scorefxns**: Convenience feature to automatically set res_type_constraint to 1in the listed functions where it is currently turned off.
-   **use_native**: use the structure specified by -in:file:native as reference
-   **use_fasta**: use a native FASTA sequence specified by the -in:file:fasta as reference
-   **use_starting**: use the starting input structure (e.g. one passed to -s) as reference
-   **use_current**: use the current structure (the one passed to apply) as the reference
-   **pdbname**: use the structure specified by the filename as the reference
-   **pssm**: a filename of a blast formatted pssm file containing the sequence profile to use
-   **chain**: 0 is all chains, otherwise if a sequence is added, align it to the specified chain
-   **scaling**: Set how to scale the given values."prob"=Boltzmann-weighted probability based on the profile score"global"= global linear fixed-zero rescalingsuch that all (pre-weighted) values fall in the range of -1.0 to 1.0"none" does no adjustment of values.
-   **matrix**: Set substitution matrix; valid:  BLOSUM62,MATCH,IDENTITY
-   **exclude_resnums**: Exclude residues from being contrained.
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use (Use the SavePoseMover to create a reference pose)
