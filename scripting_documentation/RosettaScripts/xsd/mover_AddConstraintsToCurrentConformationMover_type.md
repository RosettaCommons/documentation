-   **use_distance_cst**: use distance constraints instead of CoordinateConstraints. Probable default false.
-   **max_distance**: do not generate distance constraints beyond this distance.  Only active with use_distance_cst.
-   **coord_dev**: width (sd) for HarmonicFunc or BoundFunc.
-   **bound_width**: BoundFunc zero basin width BoundFunc; also activates use of BoundFunc (if non-zero)
-   **min_seq_sep**: Do not generate distance constraints between residues within this sequence separation.  Only active with use_distance_cst.
-   **cst_weight**: use ScalarWeightedFunc to reweight constraints by this; also activates use of HarmonicFunc (if this and bound_width are both zero)
-   **CA_only**: constrain only CA atoms. Sets bb_only and sc_tip_only to false.
-   **bb_only**: constrain only backbone atoms. Sets CA_only and sc_tip_only to false.
-   **sc_tip_only**: constrain only atoms affected by the final chi angle. Sets CA_only and bb_only to false.
-   **inter_chain**: Generate distance constraints between residues on different chains if true.  (Does not appear to generate ONLY interchain constraints.)  If false, skips constraints that would go between chains.  Only active with use_distance_cst.
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **residue_selector**: make constraints for these residues; mutually exclisuve with task_operations. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
