This mover solvates a pose based on statistics of where waters are found in hi-res crystal structures about polar side chains and backbone groups.  The input task operation is used togenerate potential hydration sites; subsequent packing steps allow waters to be added at thesepositions.

```

-   **mode**: The mode to run in (one of: remove, append, replace, or eval)
-   **lkb_overlap_dist**: The overlap distance of sidechain lkb groups necessary to generate a water
-   **lkb_clust_rad**: The redundancy cutoff for sidechain lkb groups
-   **lkb_rotset_radius**: The rotameric cutoff for lkb groups (that is the distance cutoff for which two point waters are considered rotamers of a single water)
-   **dwell_cutoff**: The dwell cutoff for water packing (before clustering)
-   **clust_radius**: The radius of clustering of packed waters
-   **clust_cutoff**: The dwell cutoff for water packing (after clustering)
-   **gen_fixed**: If set, consider generating waters over fixed regions
-   **native**: Native pose (overrides in:file:native)
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
