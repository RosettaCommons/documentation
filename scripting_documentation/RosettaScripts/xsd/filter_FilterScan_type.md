Scan all mutations allowed by a particular set of TaskOperations and test them against a filter

```xml
<FilterScan name="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)"
        triage_filter="(true_filter &string;)" keep_native="(false &bool;)"
        dump_pdb_name="(&string;)" filter="(true_filter &string;)"
        relax_mover="(null &string;)" delta="(false &bool;)"
        report_all="(false &bool;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        resfile_name="(&string;)" resfile_general_property="(nataa &string;)"

```

-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **triage_filter**: If this filter evaluates to false, don't include the mutation in the resulting resfile
-   **keep_native**: Keep the native conformation?
-   **dump_pdb_name**: Name to which to dump PDBs
-   **filter**: The filter to be evaluated on every mutation passing triage_filter
-   **relax_mover**: Mover with which to relax poses
-   **delta**: XRW TODO
-   **report_all**: Report all values
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **resfile_name**: The output resfile name; if left unspecified, it will be the input PDB name plus .resfile
-   **resfile_general_property**: Default resfile command
-   **rtmin**: Do rtmin on each residue prior to relaxation, which can lead to some energy noise but improves the fit of the mutated residue
-   **score_log_file**: Name of scorefile log
-   **dump_pdb**: Dump PDBs
-   **delta_filters**: Comma-separated list of filters to run
-   **delta_filter_thresholds**: Comma-separated list of filter thresholds
-   **log_pdb_number**: Does score log includes pdb numbering
-   **log_separator**: Which seperator character to use in score log
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
