Similar to ExtractAsymmetricUnit: given a symmetric pose, make a nonsymmetric pose that contains the entire system (all monomers). Can be used to run symmetric and asymmetric moves in the same trajectory.

```xml
<ExtractAsymmetricPose name="(&string;)" clear_sym_def="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **clear_sym_def**: If true, the symmetry_definition option key will be cleared.
