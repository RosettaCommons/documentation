This class selects all residues in close contact with a central residue, or a set of central residues, where this decision is based on atom-to-atom distances for the current set of coordinates in the Pose

```xml
<CloseContact name="(&string;)" contact_threshold="(4.5 &real;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</CloseContact>
```

-   **contact_threshold**: The distance, in Angstroms, around the residues in the central-residues set which defines the atomic-contact cutoff
-   **residue_selector**: The name of the residue selector that's used to identify the central residue(s); other residues are selected if they are in close contact with this group of central residues. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.


"Residue Selector Tag": Any of the [[ResidueSelectors]]
