Mover which adds ResidueCouplingConstraints which favors residue types such, that co-evolving residue pairs are retained during resign.To enable the constraint type the res_type_linking_constraint term must be reweighted.This mover was developed for compatibility with the Gremlin tensor format consisting of the tensor (bin) and an index file

```xml
<AddResidueCouplingConstraint name="(&string;)" tensor_file="(&string;)"
        index_file="(&string;)" strength="(1.0 &real;)"
        alphabet="(ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV- &string;)" />
```

-   **tensor_file**: (REQUIRED) Path to the co-evolution tensor file
-   **index_file**: Index file indicating residue positions in the tensor (used by Gremlin)
-   **strength**: Strength factor, gets multiplied with the eo-evolution value (tensor cell)
-   **alphabet**: Alphabet order of the tensor. The default is the Gremlin alphabet.
