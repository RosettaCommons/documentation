-   **sequence_symmetry_behaviour**: Name of the KeepSequenceSymmetry task operation defininting the intended sequence symmetry behaviour.


Subtag **SequenceSymmetry**:   

-   **residue_selectors**: Comma separated list of selected residue selectors to define the sequence symmetry. Residues in each listed selector will be linked. Each residue selector listed must be equivalent.
