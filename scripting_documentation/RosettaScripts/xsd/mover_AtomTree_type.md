```

-   **start_tree_at_chain**: Chain from which the atom tree ought to begin
-   **ab_fold_tree**: Antibody-based foldtree?
-   **host_chain**: Chain that isn't part of the antibody, which only matters if ab_fold_tree is true -- nonetheless, typically 2 if ab_fold_tree is false
-   **fold_tree_file**: Foldtree may be read in from a file, if desired
-   **docking_ft**: Use a classic docking foldtree
-   **partners**: Chain IDs of docking partners across which to make the 'docking_ft' (e.g. A_X)
-   **simple_ft**: Impose the simplest possible foldtree
-   **jump**: If the docking foldtree is desired, over which jump should it apply?
-   **resnum**: Residue central to this AtomTree resetting
-   **pdb_num**: Residue central to this AtomTree resetting
-   **connect_to**: Atom to be connected to
-   **anchor_res**: Anchor residue for the foldtree
-   **connect_from**: Corresponding atom on the anchor residue
-   **two_parts_chain1**: Is the aim actually to cut chain 1 in two parts?
-   **update_residue_variants**: Add CUTPOINT variant types according to the FoldTree
-   **from_remark**: If a KEY is provided, the FoldTree is loaded from a REMARK with that KEY.
