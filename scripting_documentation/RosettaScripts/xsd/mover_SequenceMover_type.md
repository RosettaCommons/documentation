Apply a list of movers in order.

```xml
<SequenceMover name="(&string;)" movers="(&string;)"
        mover_status="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **movers**: The movers tag takes a comma separated list of mover names
-   **mover_status**: Use MoverStatus while running. FAIL_RETRY will try the mover again. FAIL_DO_NOT_RETRY or FAIL_BAD_INPUT will exit.
