A mover for modeling docking via a LYX bond.

```xml
<UBQ_GTPaseMover name="(&string;)" binding_lysine="(&string;)"
        UBQpdb="(&string;)" extraBodies="(&xs:boolean;)"
        numTailRes="(&non_negative_integer;)" scorefilter="(&real;)"
        SASAfilter="(&real;)" lys_num="(&integer;)" />
```

-   **binding_lysine**: A residue selector giving the lysine residue on the substrate to which UBQ will bind. The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
-   **UBQpdb**: File path to UBQ pdb file
-   **extraBodies**: Whether there are extra bodies in the simulation.
-   **numTailRes**: Number of tail residues on the ubiquitin.
-   **scorefilter**: Filter for total score
-   **SASAfilter**: Filter for SASA
-   **lys_num**: An integer giving the lysine residue to which UBQ will bind. Use this or binding_lysine.
