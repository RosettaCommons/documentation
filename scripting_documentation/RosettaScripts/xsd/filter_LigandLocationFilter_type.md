Test whether the ligand is within the pocket region.

```xml
<LigandLocationFilter name="(&string;)" chain="(&string;)" radius="(&real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" >
    <center x="(&real;)" y="(&real;)" z="(&real;)" />
</LigandLocationFilter>
```

-   **chain**: (REQUIRED) Chain ID
-   **radius**: Filter is false if the distance between ligand centroid and center is greater than this value
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter


Subtag **center**:   

-   **x**: (REQUIRED) x coordinate of the center.
-   **y**: (REQUIRED) y coordinate of the center.
-   **z**: (REQUIRED) z coordinate of the center.
