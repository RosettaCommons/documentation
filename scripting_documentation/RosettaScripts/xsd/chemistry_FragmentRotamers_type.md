The FragmentRotamers chemistry will call the BCL to generate a rotameric library for the ResidueType using the protocol of Kothiwale et al. (doi:10.1186/s13321-015-0095-1) and attach it to the ResidueType. Attempting to use this will result in a runtime error unless Rosetta was successfully compiled with `extras=bcl`.
