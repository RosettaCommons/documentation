XRW TO DO

```xml
<LocalRelax name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" pack_scorefxn="(&string;)"
        min_scorefxn="(&string;)" ncyc="(&integer;)" nexp="(&integer;)"
        K="(&integer;)" max_iter="(&integer;)" ramp_schedule="(&string;)"
        verbose="(false &bool;)" ramp_cart="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Sets the scorefxn for both pack and min stages.
-   **pack_scorefxn**: Sets the scorefxn for both packing only.
-   **min_scorefxn**: Sets the scorefxn for min only
-   **ncyc**: Number of cycles to perform localrelax
-   **nexp**: Number of expansions to perform
-   **K**: K is added to NBR_RADIUS-i and NBR_RADIUS-j to determine the size of the packing/minimization shells
-   **max_iter**: maximum iterations to perform in minimization
-   **ramp_schedule**: XRW TO DO
-   **verbose**: not really verbose, just dump intermediate files to the local directory
-   **ramp_cart**: XRW TO DO
