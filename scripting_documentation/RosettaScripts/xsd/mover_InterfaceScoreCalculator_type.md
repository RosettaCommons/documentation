InterfaceScoreCalculator calculates a myriad of ligand specific scores and appends them to the output file. After scoring the complex the ligand is moved 1000 Å away from the protein. The model is then scored again. An interface score is calculated for each score term by subtracting separated energy from complex energy.

```xml
<InterfaceScoreCalculator name="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" native="(&string;)"
        native_ensemble_best="(false &bool;)" normalize="(&string;)"
        compute_grid_scores="(false &bool;)" grid_set="(default &string;)" />
```

-   **chains**: (REQUIRED) Comma separated chains to dock.
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Scorefxn of choice.
-   **native**: This is your native pdb without interface mutations. If a native structure is specified, 4 additional score terms are calculated: ligand_centroid_travel, ligand_radious_of_gyration, ligand_rms_no_super, and ligand_rms_with_super.
-   **native_ensemble_best**: If true, the native pose has multiple residues for the given chains, and the travel and rmsd metrics will be computed as the best (lowest) value from any of them.
-   **normalize**: The normalization function you wish to use.
-   **compute_grid_scores**: If compute_grid_scores is true, the scores for each grid will be calculated. This may result in the regeneration of the scoring grids, which can be slow.
-   **grid_set**: The Grid Set to use when computing grid scores.
