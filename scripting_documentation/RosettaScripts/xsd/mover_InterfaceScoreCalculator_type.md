InterfaceScoreCalculator calculates a myriad of ligand specific scores and appends them to the output file. After scoring the complex the ligand is moved 1000 Ã… away from the protein. The model is then scored again. An interface score is calculated for each score term by subtracting separated energy from complex energy.

```xml
<InterfaceScoreCalculator name="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" native="(&string;)"
        native_ensemble_best="(false &bool;)" normalize="(&string;)"
        compute_grid_scores="(false &bool;)" score_in_membrane="(false &bool;)"
        grid_set="(default &string;)" />
```

-   **chains**: (REQUIRED) Comma separated chains to dock.
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Scorefxn of choice.
-   **native**: This is your native pdb without interface mutations. If a native structure is specified, 4 additional score terms are calculated: ligand_centroid_travel, ligand_radious_of_gyration, ligand_rms_no_super, and ligand_rms_with_super.
-   **native_ensemble_best**: If true, the native pose has multiple residues for the given chains, and the travel and rmsd metrics will be computed as the best (lowest) value from any of them.
-   **normalize**: The normalization function you wish to use.
-   **compute_grid_scores**: If compute_grid_scores is true, the scores for each grid will be calculated. This may result in the regeneration of the scoring grids, which can be slow.
-   **score_in_membrane**: If true, the interface score of the pose will be computed in solution and in the membrane. Requires pose to have membrane_info object as set in RosettaMP.
-   **grid_set**: The Grid Set to use when computing grid scores.
