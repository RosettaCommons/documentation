A residue selector that takes one of the following options: "selector", "selectors", "residue_selector", "residue_selectors", and performs the same function no matter the option given. Takes arbitrarily many residue selectors within the option and performs and/or/not boolean logic.

```xml
<Logic name="(&string;)" selector="(&string;)" selectors="(&string;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" residue_selectors="(&string;)" />
```

-   **selector**: Residue selectors separated by and/or/not boolean logic.
-   **selectors**: Residue selectors separated by and/or/not boolean logic.
-   **residue_selector**: Residue selectors separated by and/or/not boolean logic.
-   **residue_selectors**: Residue selectors separated by and/or/not boolean logic.
