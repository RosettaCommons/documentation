A TaskOperation to restrict designable amino acids depending on the probabilities from a PerResidueProbabilitiesMetric

```xml
<RestrictAAsFromProbabilities name="(&string;)" metric="(&string;)"
        prob_cutoff="(0.0001 &real;)" delta_prob_cutoff="(0 &real;)"
        use_cached_data="(false &bool;)" cache_prefix="(&string;)"
        cache_suffix="(&string;)" fail_on_missing_cache="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **metric**: (REQUIRED) A PerResidueProbabilitiesMetric to restrict amino acid identities from.
-   **prob_cutoff**: Probability cutoff for amino acids to consider for sampling. Defaults to 0.0001
-   **delta_prob_cutoff**: Delta probability (current-proposed) cutoff for amino acids to consider for sampling. Defaults to 0 (as likely as the current)
-   **use_cached_data**: Use any data stored in the datacache that matches the set metrics name (and any prefix/suffix.)  Data is stored during a SimpleMetric's apply function, which is called during RunSimpleMetrics
-   **cache_prefix**: Any prefix used during apply (RunSimpleMetrics), that we will match on if use_cache is true
-   **cache_suffix**: Any suffix used during apply (RunSimpleMetrics), that we will match on if use_cache is true
-   **fail_on_missing_cache**: If use_cached_data is True and cache is not found, should we fail?
