The inverse of SetupForSymmetry: given a symmetric pose, make a nonsymmetric pose that contains only the asymmetric unit.

-   **keep_virtual**: If true, virtual atoms will be left in the pose. If false, the extracted asymmetric unit will not contain virtual atoms.
-   **keep_unknown_aas**: Deprecated option.  All de-symmetrization will keep non-canonical amino acids.
