Count the number of rotatable bonds (as determined by Rosetta).

```xml
<NChi name="(&string;)" residue="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        exclude_proton="(true &bool;)" threshold="(&real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **residue**: (REQUIRED) Residue for which to calculate the number of rotatable bonds
-   **exclude_proton**: Don't count proton chis
-   **threshold**: Fail if the number of rotatable bonds is greater than this.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
