Selects residues based on per residue score of the given score_type.

```xml
<ScoreTermValueBased name="(&string;)" selector="(&string;)"
        resnums="(ALL &string;)" lower_threshold="(&real;)"
        upper_threshold="(&real;)" score_type="(&string;)"
        score_fxn="(&string;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</ScoreTermValueBased>
```

-   **selector**: . The name of a previously declared residue selector or a logical expression of AND, NOT (!), OR, parentheses, and the names of previously declared residue selectors. Any capitalization of AND, NOT, and OR is accepted. An exclamation mark can be used instead of NOT. Boolean operators have their traditional priorities: NOT then AND then OR. For example, if selectors s1, s2, and s3 have been declared, you could write: 's1 or s2 and not s3' which would select a particular residue if that residue were selected by s1 or if it were selected by s2 but not by s3.
-   **resnums**: pose number of the subset of residues to be considered. The default is 'ALL'.
-   **lower_threshold**: (REQUIRED) residues scoring equal to or above this threshold will be selected
-   **upper_threshold**: (REQUIRED) residues scoring equal to or below this threshold will be selected
-   **score_type**: (REQUIRED) the score type to be used for selection
-   **score_fxn**: (REQUIRED) the score function to be used for evaluation
