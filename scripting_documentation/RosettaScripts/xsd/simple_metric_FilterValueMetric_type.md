---
A metric which converts the result of a Filter::report_sm() calculation into a RealMetric. This is intended primarily as a compatibility shim, and not for greenfield code.

```xml
<FilterValueMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        filter="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **filter**: (REQUIRED) The filter to convert into a SimpleMetric.
