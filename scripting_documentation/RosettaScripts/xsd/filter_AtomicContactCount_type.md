Counts sidechain carbon-carbon contacts among the specified residues under the given distance cutoff.

```xml
<AtomicContactCount name="(&string;)" distance="(4.5 &real;)"
        non_local="(false &bool;)" res_contact="(false &bool;)"
        count_SD_NE1="(false &bool;)" partition="(none &partition_types;)"
        normalize_by_sasa="(0 &bool;)" normalize_by_carbon_count="(0 &bool;)"
        ss_only="(0 &bool;)" taskA="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        taskB="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        packer_palette="(&named_packer_palette;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" sym_dof_name="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **distance**: Distance across which to count a contact
-   **non_local**: Detect only non-local contacts, i.e., sequence distance more than 2. Positions in separate chains are automatically considered non-local
-   **res_contact**: Only count one atom contact per residue. This option ignores normalize_by_sasa and normalize_by_carbon_count
-   **count_SD_NE1**: In addition to carbon atoms, count methionine SD and tryptophan NE1
-   **partition**: Partition across which to define contacts
-   **normalize_by_sasa**: Normalize contacts by sasa
-   **normalize_by_carbon_count**: Normalize contacts by number of carbons
-   **ss_only**: Only consider SS elements (i.e., non-L)
-   **taskA**: Comma-separated list of task operations to use for selecting residue set A.  This is an alternative to using "task_operations" to select a single group of residues.
-   **taskB**: Comma-separated list of task operations to use for selecting residue set B.  This is an alternative to using "task_operations" to select a single group of residues.
-   **task_operations**: A comma-separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **packer_palette**: A previously-defined PackerPalette to use, which specifies the set of residue types with which to design (to be pruned with TaskOperations).
-   **jump**: Jump across which to define contacts
-   **sym_dof_name**: Name of the sym dof -- a symmetry-aware jump identifier
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
