Calculate the synthetic accessiblity score (of Ertl and Schuffenhauer doi:10.1186/1758-2946-1-8) for a residue.

```xml
<SAScore name="(&string;)" residue="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        threshold="(&real;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **residue**: (REQUIRED) Residue to calculate SAScore on
-   **threshold**: Fail if the SAScore is greater than or equal to this value.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
