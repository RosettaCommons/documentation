# Suggested Options

Rosetta is constantly being improved.
Unfortunately, improvements are often opt-in even if they are universally (or nearly universally) helpful.

Here are a few options that would be default if we did not care about maintaining old behavior:

* `-parser:never_rerun_filters true` prevents rosetta_scripts from calling the same filter multiple times. In some eyes, this flag enables the expected behavior and the legacy behavior is surprising to newcomers.
