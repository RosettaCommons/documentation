#Rosetta command-line options

The following page gives an overview of the most commonly used categories of options in Rosetta. **This is not a complete listing** and is only meant to give a brief description of commonly used options.

*For a more comprehensive list of Rosetta command line options, see the [[full options list|full-options-list]].* Note that some application-specific options may not be included in the full options list.

* [[Input options|input-options]]: Options to supply most input files to Rosetta and control the way Rosetta reads and processes those files.
* [[Output options|output-options]]: Options that control output from Rosetta (file formats, tracer output, etc.).
* [[Run options|run-options]]: Options that control how Rosetta runs jobs in a technical, computational sense.
* [[Score options|score-options]]: Options that relate to the Score Function.
* [[Packing options|packing-options]]: Options that control the behavior of the packer (including resfile input, resfile input, and additional options).
* [[Database options|Database-options]]: Options for using relational databases within Rosetta.
* [[Renamed and Deprecated Options|Renamed-and-Deprecated-Options]]: Options that may appear in older Rosetta runs but which have changed or been removed are listed here.
