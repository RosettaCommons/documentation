<!-- --- title: Fasta File -->

Sequence data contains sequences of residues without structural data. The derivation and accuracy of such files is the subject of research but the formats tend to be simple.

Name
====

```
*.fasta
```

Application purpose
===========================================

Sequence information generated by the FASTA sequence alignment package.

Format
======

Every Rosetta RNA fasta file will look a little different from ordinary FASTA files. For one thing, there will be chain information in the header line (the one that begins with a right angle bracket) and there may be multiple chains. For another, the RNA sequence will be all lowercase (to permit specification of uppercase protein residues and lowercase RNA). For a third, chemically modified nucleotides may be specified by replacing an ordinary letter like `u` with a special code `X` which is then modified by a "full residue name" like `X[5MU]` (which translates to "5-methyl uridine").

Example
=======

```
>foobar A:1-6
gX[5MC]ggau

>foobar B:1-6
auccX[7MG]c
```

This format is used by applications including [[stepwise|stepwise]], [[ERRASER2]], and [[FARFAR2]].
