PyMOL
=====

[PyMOL](http://www.pymol.org/) is a molecular visualization tool widely
used by the Rosetta community.

The [PyMOL Wiki](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page) contains
documentation on the program methods and numerous examples. Beginners
should start
[with this tutorial](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Practical_Pymol_for_Beginners).
A simple [workshop](https://www.pyrosetta.org/documentation/tutorials) is part of the
[PyRosetta](/index.php/PyRosetta "PyRosetta") tutorials.

If you are building PyMOL from source on Linux (this does not take long
and is explained
[here](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install)) then you may
need to install the python-dev and glutg3-dev packages and possibly the
mesa-common-dev package as well.  Some notes on building PyMOL for Python 2.7 on a Python 3 system are included below.

Information on making movies in PyMOL can be found at  [http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/PLoS](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/PLoS).

PyMOL\_Mover
------------

PyMOL is so popular in the community, we developed a Mover to send
Rosetta data directly to PyMOL.

### PyMOL Side

#### *Setting Up PyMOL*

In PyMOL, run the PyMOL-RosettaServer.py script, found at
`<path to Rosetta main>/source/src/python/PyRosetta/src/PyMOL-RosettaServer.py` (the main directory of PyRosetta). This will
start the listener and output information about the connection
established. No further work should be required to view PyMOL\_Mover
output from the same computer. 

We recommend creating a `.pymolrc` file in your home folder, and adding the following line: 

`run <path to Rosetta main>/source/src/python/PyRosetta/src/PyMOL-RosettaServer.py`

This way is convenient: the PyMOL-Rosetta link is established each time you start PyMOL.

#### *Changing PyMOL Listener IP*

`start_rosetta_server`

It's that simple. This method of the Server script automatically connects
to the machine's current IP. This IP address can be set manually and the
Server script defaultly connects at 127.0.0.1. Make sure that the
connection is to an accessible IP and that the PyMOL\_Mover is
outputting to that IP. To change the IP manually use either command
below at a PyMOL command prompt:

`start_rosetta_server 187.1.3.37, 9001 \\` 

or 

`cmd.start_rosetta_server("187.1.3.37","9001")`

### Rosetta Usage

Here are the options for observing a Rosetta simulation through JD2, Rosetta's job manager). See below for PyRosetta code. 

```
-show_simulation_in_pymol <argument, default=5.0> 
```

- Attach PyMOL observer to pose at the beginning of the simulation, and outputs a new PyMOL "state" every <argument> seconds. A value of 0 indicates to not skip any packets from sending! Don't forget to run the PyMOLPyRosettaServer.py script within PyMOL!

```
-update_pymol_on_energy_changes_only 'Boolean'
```
 - default = 'false', 
 - 'Only Update the simulation in on energy change.  Useful if pymol observer is segfaulting on length changes.

```
-update_pymol_on_conformation_changes_only 'Boolean'
```
 - default = 'false'
 - Only update the simulation in pymol on conformation change.

```
-keep_pymol_simulation_history, 'Boolean'
```
 - default = 'false'
 - Keep history when using show_simulation_in_pymol flag?


### PyRosetta Usage

#### *Sending Structures*

Application of the mover sends pose coordinate data to PyMOL rendering
an image of the structure. Simply apply the mover to a pose. You can
achieve the same results by using dump\_pdb to produce a .pdb of the
pose and load it into PyMOL...but the mover is much faster and avoids
unnecessary file writing.\
\
 `pymover = PyMOL_Mover() pymover.apply(pose)`

#### *Sending Energy*

Use the send\_energy method to color the structure in PyMOL based on the
residue relative energies. Currently, the color spectrum spans from blue
(low energy=happy) to red (high energy=sad). Make sure the pose has been
scored first. The send\_energy can accept a ScoreType name and color
residues in PyMOL based on this score term of the last score function
applied.

` pymover.send_energy(pose) pymover.send_energy(pose,"fa_atr") pymover.update_energy=True pymover.apply(pose) pymover.energy_type="fa_sol" pymover.apply(pose)`

The PyMOL\_Mover features a update\_energy option which, when True,
automatically colors residues by energy when the Mover is applied. The
score term sent can be set with the PyMOL\_Mover.energy\_type option.

#### *Changing Mover IP*

To send PyMOL\_Mover output to a new IP address, simply change the
PyMOL\_Mover options as specified below:

` pymover.link.udp_ip = '127.0.0.1' pymover.link.udp_port = 65000 pymover.apply(pose)`

#### *Keeping History*

Another useful PyMOL\_Mover feature is the keep\_history flag. When
marked True, poses with the same "name" (see below) are loaded into new
states of the associated PyMOL object ie. applying the PyMOL\_Mover does
not overwrite the structure in PyMOL but instead loads it into the next
state. Protocol movies can be created easily using PyMOL's movie
building features and these output states.

` pymover.keep_history=True pymover.apply(pose) other_mover.apply(pose) pymover.apply(pose)`

To accurately view intermediate changes, you can change the pose name.
This will result in a different object when the pose data is loaded into
PyMOL. To change a pose name use: ` pose.pdb_info().name("new_name")`
Remember, color in PyMOL is per object NOT per state so any successive
coloring will erase the old coloring (another reason you may want to
change the pose name when inspecting a protocol).

#### *PyMOL Observer*

The PyMOL\_Observer object waits for "events" to happen on the pose and
when triggered, applies its own PyMOL\_Mover to the structure. This is
ideal for situations where you don't want to apply the mover directly,
such as lengthy protocols or quick inspection. Since a PyMOL\_Observer
has a PyMOL\_Mover, all the options above can be set on its mover
(called pymol) including keep\_history, link.udp\_ip, and
update\_energy.

` pyobs = PyMOL_Observer() pyobs.add_observer(pose) pyobs.pymol().update_energy=True`

##Getting PyMOLObserver working on a Python3 system
Some Linux systems, including Arch based linux such as Manjaro, Antergos and ArchBang, now ship with Python3 as the default.
Python2 is also available.
Pymol (installed with Python3) does not work with Rosetta's PyMOLObserver.

For compiling and installing Pymol with Python2.7, for a version compatible with Rosetta:

1) Requirements
Libraries as well as development files (headers) of the following software is required:
* Subversion
* Python (with distutils)
* Pmw (Python Megawidgets)
* OpenGL driver (NVidia works)
* GLEW
* GLUT (freeglut)
* libpng
* freetype
* libxml2 (optional, for COLLADA export, disable with --no-libxml)
* msgpack-c 1.0+ (optional, for fast MMTF loading, new in SVN r4167, disable with --use-msgpackc=no)

2) Get latest source from SVN
Let's say we will download the Pymol source code to /tmp. This will download the latest source to /tmp/pymol:
```
cd /tmp
svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/pymol/code/trunk/pymol
cd pymol
```
3) Compiling and installing Pymol

This will install PyMOL as normal user into ${HOME}/pymol-svn:
```
prefix=${HOME}/pymol-svn
modules=$prefix/modules
python2.7 setup.py build install --home=$prefix --install-lib=$modules --install-scripts=$prefix
```
Now launch PyMOL like this:
```
${HOME}/pymol-svn/pymol
```
To add this new PyMOL to your path:
```
sudo ln -s ${HOME}/pymol-svn/pymol /usr/bin/pymol
```
4) Connecting to Rosetta

So long as you are using this freshly-built pymol, it will work with Rosetta normally; do not use a previously-installed Python3 PyMOL by mistake.
