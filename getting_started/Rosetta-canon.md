#The Rosetta canon

_In the beginning Rosetta was created from the Centroid and the Fragment._  
_And the Fullatom Pose was without Conformation, and Null; and darkness_ was _upon the potential energy surface. And the Students of Baker moved upon the face of protein structure._  
_And Rosetta said, Let there be the Metropolis criterion: and there was convergence._  
_And Rosetta saw the folding funnel, and saw that it was good._ 
_Thus the Students of Baker divided the models from the decoys._  

Rosetta has a relatively long academic history, and there is a substantial set of papers that are foundational to both the content of the code-base and the accomplishments of its users.
We distilled these references to a core canon: the papers we assume each other to have read, the papers we wish we had read, the papers we should have read, and, in lucky cases, the papers we have read.

These are organized by field in order of Rosetta entering the field, and chronological order within each group.

Methods in Enzymology.  
This paper, often called the **Rohl review**, is a window into Rosetta's early scorefunction, and remains an excellent reference for early forms of the score function terms. It can be a little hard to find online, but paper photocopies float around most Rosetta labs.

* Kuhlman B, Dantas G, Ireton GC, Varani G, Stoddard BL, Baker D (2003)  
[Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy.] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631033) (pubmed link)  
Science 302:1364-8  
This paper, often called the **Top7 paper**, is primarily a design paper (see below), but is important for scoring as it introduces sequence-related energy terms (reference energies, p_aa_pp, etc).
The supplemental is most relevant for scoring.

J Mol Biol 331:281-99

J Mol Biol 381:1068-87  
Chaudhury and Gray demonstrate algorithms that echo traditional lock-in-key complexing (rigid body docking) and more sophisticated models (conformer selection via EnsembleDock; induced fit via backbone minimization on the smaller partner of the complex; a combination of both) and validate the EnsembleDocking protocol by illustrating that docking-competent conformers exist in the unbound ensemble.

* Sircar A, Chaudhury S, Kilambi KP, Berrondo M, Gray JJ (2010)  
[A generalized approach to sampling backbone conformations with RosettaDock for CAPRI rounds 13-19.] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20535822) (pubmed link)

Science 302:1364-8  
Kuhlman et al. demonstrate the computational design of a protein with an entirely novel fold.
The significance of this result arises because prior design efforts involved stabilizing or modifying existing, known folds; the ability to _de novo_ create a protein was wholly original.

[Engineering a protein-protein interface using a computationally designed library.] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20974935) (pubmed link)  
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:19296-301  
Computational design at twenty amino acid positions was used to semi-direct two protein libraries, which greatly outperformed the control library where all residues were allowed: the former produced multiple mid-nanomolar binders while the latter could not produce bunders under fifty micromolar after four rounds of selection.

Mutational analysis
-------------------

* Mandell DJ, Coutsias EA, Kortemme T (2009)
