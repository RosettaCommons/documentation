Using Rosetta requires some pre-existing understanding of biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular modeling.

Jeff Gray at Johns Hopkins teaches a course very relevant to understanding how to work with Rosetta, and that [course page](https://graylab.jhu.edu/resources.php/courses) is a fantastic (and often Rosetta-specific) resource.
It even has videos of lectures.
