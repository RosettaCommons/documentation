#Writing a Rosetta Application

One of the main design goals of Rosetta is that writing new applications and extension of existing protocols be easy. This section is intended to show a developer how to write new application with a new protocol. The reader will be taken through the process

-   writing a new Mover
-   writing a new application using the Job Distributor and the new Mover.
-   Using Doxygen document your code and write a tutorial page for your application

After reading this guide the reader should be able to write their own Rosetta application.

This guide is under construction.  Clearly a "Writing a 'Writing a Rosetta Application' help guide" page is needed.
