#Rna Denovo: RNA 3D structure modeling

#Deprecation notice

As of mid-2020, your best choice for whole-RNA modeling with fragment assembly is [[FARFAR2]], which uses the same executable and many of the same flags. FARFAR2 represents a new set of defaults and some changes in behavior, so this documentation will be a little out of date. 

#Application purpose
To produce <i>de novo</i> models of small RNA motifs through Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full Atom Refinement (FARFAR).

Note that most of the functionality of rna_denovo/FARFAR is now available on a [ROSIE FARFAR server](http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/rna_denovo), if you want to do some easy tests.

#Code and Demo


The central code for the *rna\_denovo* application is in `       src/protocols/rna/RNA_DeNovoProtocol.cc      ` .

For a 'minimal' demo example of the RNA fragment assembly and full-atom minimization protocol and input files, see

`       demos/public/RNA_Denovo      `

#Application purpose

This code is intended to give three-dimensional de novo models of single-stranded RNAs or multi-stranded RNA motifs, with the prospect of reaching high (near-atomic-resolution) accuracy. The application slots into workflows for 3D RNA modeling described at the [Ribokit](https://ribokit.github.io/) site.

#Algorithm

The RNA structure modeling algorithm in Rosetta is based on the assembly of short (1 to 3 nucleotide) fragments from existing RNA crystal structures whose sequences match subsequences of the target RNA. The Fragment Assembly of RNA (FARNA) algorithm is a Monte Carlo process, guided by a low-resolution knowledge-based energy function. The models can then be further refined in an all-atom potential to yield more realistic structures with cleaner hydrogen bonds and fewer clashes; the resulting energies are also better at discriminating native-like conformations from non-native conformations. The two-step protocol has been named FARFAR (Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full Atom Refinement).

#Limitations


-   This method has been demonstrated to reach atomic accuracy for small motifs (12 residues or less) â€“ the current bottleneck for larger RNAs is the difficulty of complete conformational sampling (as in other applications in Rosetta to, e.g., protein de novo modeling). On-going work attempts to resolve this issue, but requires great computational expense (see [[stepwise]]).

-   For larger RNAs, it appears most efficient to just carry out fragment assembly without refinement, specifying secondary structure (as described below). Although atomic accuracy is unlikely, models accurate at nucleotide or helix resolution can be achieved, especially with constraints from experiments. See also: [[RNA assembly with experimental pair-wise constraints|rna-assembly]] and, more up to date, [[RNA de novo setup|rna-denovo-setup]].

-   As with most other modes in Rosetta, the final ensemble of models is not guaranteed to be a Boltzmann ensemble. There is some progress happening in that direction for RNA with the [[recces]] application.

#Modes


-   By default, the code runs Monte Carlo fragment assembly, optimized in a knowledge-based low-resolution potential.

-   It is strongly suggested that you run with "-minimize\_rna", which permits the refinement in the high-resolution Rosetta potential, and results in models with few steric clashes and 'cleaner' hydrogen bonds.

-   There are variations of the code that permit just scoring or just minimizing in the high resolution Rosetta potential. These are described below in Tips.

#Input Files


##Required file

FARNA (rna_denovo) can accept sequence & secondary structure from command line, and does not require any files. However, using file input can help with organizing runs.

##Optional additional files:

-   The [[fasta file]]: it is a sequence file for your RNA. Its header lines can specify chains and numbering for the output structures, too.

-   The [[secondary structure file|rna-secondary-structure-file]]: holds the secondary structure for the RNA in dot-parens notation, if known.

-   Native pdb file, if all-heavy-atom rmsd's are desired. Must be in Rosetta's [PDB format for RNA](#File-Format).

##How to include these files.

A sample command line is the following:

```
rna_denovo.<exe> -sequence "ucaggu aagcag" -secstruct "(....( )....)" -nstruct 2 -out:file:silent test.out -minimize_rna 
```

or if you want to supply the sequence & secondary structure in files:

```
rna_denovo.<exe> -fasta chunk002_1lnt_.fasta -secstruct_file chunk002_1lnt_.secstruct -nstruct 2 -out:file:silent test.out -minimize_rna 
```

The code takes about 1 minute to generate two models.

The fasta file has the RNA name on the first line (after \>), and the sequence on the second line. Valid letters are a,c,g, and u. Example fasta and secstruct files are available in `       demos/public/rna_denovo      ` .

#Tips


##File Format 
<a name="File-Format" />

Note that in older versions of Rosetta, the PDBs may have residue types marked as rA, rC, rG, and rU and unusual atom names. Versions of Rosetta released after 3.5 have residue and atom names matching BMRB/NDB standard nomenclature. If you have a "standard" PDB file, there is a python script available to convert it to current Rosetta format:

```
tools/rna_tools/bin/make_rna_rosetta_ready.py <pdb file>
```

##Can I specify non-Watson-Crick pairs? 
<a name="Can-I-specify-non-Watson-Crick-pairs?" />

You can also specify base pairs that must be forced, even at the expense of creating temporary chainbreaks, in the params file, with a flag like

```
-obligate_pair_explicit 2 11 W W A
```

This also allows the specification of non-Watson-Crick base pairs. In the line above, you can change the W's to H (hoogsteen edge) or S (sugar edge); and the A to P (antiparallel to parallel). The base edges are essentially the same as those defined in the classification by Leontis & Westhof. The latter (A/P) are determined by the relative orientation of base normals. [The cis/trans classification of Leontis & Westhof would be an alternate to the A/P, but we found A/P more convenient to compute and to visually assess. You can supply C/T for cis/trans, and it will be converted based on a lookup table.] The base pairs are drawn from a library of base pairs extracted from the crystallographic model of the large ribosomal subunit 1JJ2.

When specifying pairs, if there are not sufficient strand breaks to allow all the pairs to form, the code will attempt to choose a (non-stem) RNA suite to put in a cutpoint, which can be closed during fragment assembly with the -close\_loops option. If you want to pre-specify where this cutpoint will be chosen, add a flag like

```
-cutpoint_closed 6
```
##Use Of Alternative Fragment Sources


By default the RNA fragment assembly makes use of bond torsions derived from the large ribosome subunit crystal structure 1jj2, which have been pre-extracted in 1jj2. torsions (available in the database). If you want to use torsions drawn from a separate PDB (or set of PDBs), the following command will do the job.

```
rna_database.<exe>  -vall_torsions -s my_new_RNA1.pdb my_new_RNA2.pdb -o my_new_set.torsions
```

The resulting file is just a text file with the RNA's torsion angles listed for each residue. Then, when creating models, use the following flag with the rna\_denovo application:

```
-vall_torsions my_new_set.torsions
```

Similarly, the database of base pair geometries can be created with `rna_database -jump_library`, and then specified in the rna\_denovo application with `-jump_library_file`.

Last, a database of base pair step geometries (see [below](#Can-I-use-base-pair-steps?)) can be created with `rna_database -bps_database`. By default, this creates files for the standard canonical base pair steps. To also parse out noncanonical base pair steps, use  `-general_bps`; and `-use_lores_base_pair_classification` catches all pairs, including ones that are held in place by base-phosphate contacts but no base-base hydrogen bonds (as occurs in the sarcin/ricin loop). 

##Can I use fragments that take advantage of our rich database of base pairings? 
<a name="Can-I-use-base-pair-steps?" />

Yes, by using the flags `-bps_moves`, you can ask the application to try to  draw from a database of "base pair steps". There are two kinds of those steps. 

First, for stems (specified by secondary structure file), adjacent base pairs form base pair steps, involving four nucleotides (i,i+1,j,j+1) where (i,j+1) and (i+1,j) are paired. There is a set of such steps in Rosetta's database, drawn from the ribosome. The RNA's fold tree will be set up with appropriate jump connections and cutpoints so that those base step conformations can be substituted in during fragment assembly.

Second, if you have specified obligate pairs -- but with unknown pairing edges and orientations ('X' in the params file) -- special fragments will be set up for such pairs that involve nucleotides that are adjacent in sequence. For example, if your params file contains a flag like:
```
-secstruct_general .((....)..).
```
or 
```
-obligate_pair 2 11  3 8 
```
using the flag `-bps_moves` will trigger moves that substitute sequence-matched fragments for the nucleotides at (2,3,8,11). This happens if on at least one strand, the base pair step involves residues that are immediately contiguous (2 and 3 in this example). On the other strand, the base pair step must involve residues that are contiguous are have no more than 3 intervening 'bulge' residues (8 and 11 in this example). Note that these base pair steps will generally include noncanonical pairs.  There's a demo of this functionality applied to model the sarcin/ricin loop in `demos/public/RNA_Denovo_with_base_pair_steps/`

Note: For noncanonical pairs, we don't allow specification of edges and orientations at the moment -- the database gets pretty sparse with that level of specification. Also note: If there is a base pair step that includes a pair both inside a Watson/Crick stem and a more general 'obligate pair', the stem pairing may actually come out as non-Watson-Crick, which often happens anyway for base pairs at the edge of stems.


##What do the scores mean?

##How do I just score?
<a name="How-do-I-just-score?" />

To get a score of an input PDB, you can run the 'denovo' protocol but ask there to be no fragment assembly cycles and no rounds of minimization:

```
rna_score.<exe> -database <path to database>  -s <pdb file> [<pdb file 2> ...] -out:file:silent SCORE.out  [-native <native pdb>]
```

If you want to minimize under the low resolution RNA potential (used in FARNA), add the flag '-score:weights rna\_lores.wts'. Then you can check the score in SCORE.out:

```
 grep SCORE SCORE.out
```

But this is not recommended if you are trying to score a model deposited in the PDB or created by other software â€“ see next [How do I just minimize?](#How-do-I-just-minimize?)

##How do I just get RMSDs to a native?

`rna_score` can take your models (in 'silent' format) and figure out all-heavy-atom RMSD while preserving all the energy terms from the run. Try:

```

##How do I just minimize? 
<a name="How-do-I-just-minimize?" />

If you take a PDB created outside Rosetta, very small clashes may be strongly penalized by the Rosetta all-atom potential. Instead of scoring, you should probably do a short minimize, run:

```
rna_minimize.<exe> -database <path to database>  -s <pdb file> [<pdb file 2> ...] -out:file:silent MINIMIZE.out  [-native <native pdb>]
```

If you want to minimize under the low resolution RNA potential (used in FARNA), add the flag '-score:weights rna\_lores.wts'. Then check out the scores in MINIMIZE.out.

```
 grep SCORE MINIMIZE.out
```

You can extract models from silent files as described in [Extraction Of Models Into PDB Format](#Extraction-Of-Models-Into-PDB-Format), but you'll also get models with the same names as your input with the suffix '\_minimize.pdb'.

##Other options

For building models of larger RNAs, check these sections: [[RNA assembly with experimental pair-wise constraints|rna-assembly]] and [[RNA denovo setup|rna-denovo-setup]].

#Post Processing

##Extraction Of Models Into PDB Format
<a name="Extraction-Of-Models-Into-PDB-Format" />

The models from the above run are stored in compressed format in the file test.out, along with lines representing the score components. You can see the models in PDB format with the conversion command.

```
rna_extract.<exe>  -in:file:silent test.out -in:file:silent_struct_type  rna -database <path to database>
```

##How can I cluster models?
<a name="How-can-I-cluster-models?" />

There is one executable for clustering, it currently requires that all the models be in a silent file and have scores. (If you don't have such a silent file, use the rna\_score executable described in [How do I just score?](#How-do-I-just-score?) ). Here's the command line:

```
 rna_cluster.<exe>   -database <path to database>    -in:file:silent <silent file with models> -out:file:silent <silent file with clustered models>   [-cluster:radius <rmsd threshold>] [-nstruct <maximum number of clusters>]
```

The way this clustering works is it simply goes through the models in order of energy, and if a model is more than the rmsd threshold than the existing clusters, it spawns a new cluster.

#New things since last release

Written in 2008. 

Last updates: Nov. 2011 and Aug. 2014 by Rhiju Das (rhiju [at] stanford.edu).
Added applications rna\_minimize, rna\_helix, rna\_cluster. Updated torsional potential to be smooth.

Under-the-hood refactoring is occurring in 2015-2016. [[Link to plan|farna-refactor]] (for developers only)
