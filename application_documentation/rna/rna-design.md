This document updates documentation written in 2008 by Rhiju Das (rhiju [at] stanford.edu) into the latest documentation format. Last update: April 2011.

Code and Demo
=============

The central code for the *rna\_design* application is in `       apps/public/rna/rna_design.cc      ` with core routines run through the Rosetta packer.

For a 'minimal' demo example of RNA design:

`       demos/public/RNA_Design      ` [in the release version]

There is also a nice server available for this code at [rnaredesign.stanford.edu](http://rnaredesign.stanford.edu)

Purpose
===========================================

This code is intended to carry out fixed backbone design of RNA sequences given an input backbone.

Algorithm
=========

This application carries out combinatorial optimization of nucleobase type and conformation along with 2'-OH torsions, in the context of a pre-specified RNA backbone. It is very similar to the Rosetta fixed-backbone protein design algorithm, and has been used to test the new Rosetta RNA potential. Unfortunately, it is not presently very optimized for speed; the precalculation of rotamer energies takes a while. Runs on RNA backbones longer than \~ten nucleotides take many minutes or hours; algorithm improvements implemented in future releases will greatly speed this up.

Limitations
===========

-   This method does not currently include any optimization of the backbone positions.
-   This method does not yet support the design of a subset of nucleotide positions.
-   For a preview of how to do both effectively, check out the new [[stepwise|stepwise]] framework.

Input Files
===========

Required file
-------------

Just the PDB file with desired backbone.

How to run with this file.
---------------------------

```
rna_design.<exe> -s chunk001_uucg_RNA.pdb   -nstruct 3  -ex1:level 4 -dump -score:weights farna/rna_hires.wts
```

This demo redesigns a 'UUCG' tetraloop on a single-base pair RNA 'helix', as a small 6-nucleotide test case. As illustration, only 3 designs are output. It takes about 15 seconds to run. The typical sequence output is cuuggg (native is cuucgg).

Options
=======

```
-in:file:s                                       Name(s) of single PDB file(s) to process. [FileVector]

                                                 The integers that follow the ex flags specify the pattern
                                                 for chi dihedral angle sampling.
                                                 There are currently 8 options; they all include the original
                                                 chi dihedral angle No. 4 means: EX_TWO_HALF_STEP_STDDEVS

Tips

What do the scores mean?
------------------------

The most common question we get is on what the terms in the 'SCORE lines' of silent files mean. Here's a brief rundown, with more explanation in the papers cited above.

```

================

If you use the sample flag files, there are also other output files generated.
