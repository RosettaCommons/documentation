Use Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) data measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to evaluate protein structural information and to supplemented computational prediction methods with a scoring function to quantify the agreement with HDX data.

### Categorical

Use strength categories that corresponded to HDX rates (rather than the quantitative exchange rates) to score.

### Numerical

Use quantitative protection factors (PFs) from HDX-NMR for scoring.

### Usage

To use the application, the following command line options need to be specified:
